        "article.text": "Reuters/Lucas Jackson\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos may be the world's richest person, with a net worth of about $112 billion (\u00a378 billion), but at least some of those working on his warehouse floors are apparently so desperate to keep their jobs that they don't even take time to use a restroom.\n\nThe author James Bloodworth went undercover at an Amazon warehouse in Staffordshire, UK, for a book on low wages in Britain. He found that the warehouse's fulfillment workers, who run around Amazon's massive warehouses gathering products for delivery, had a \"toilet bottle\" system in place because the bathrooms were too sparse to get to quickly.\n\n\"For those of us who worked on the top floor, the closest toilets were down four flights of stairs,\" Bloodworth told The Sun. \"People just peed in bottles because they lived in fear of being \u00addisciplined over 'idle time' and \u00adlosing their jobs just because they needed the loo.\"\n\nAmazon is known to track how fast its warehouse workers can pick and package items from its shelves, imposing strictly timed breaks and targets. It issues warning points for those who don't meet its goals or who take extended breaks.\n\nA separate survey found almost three-quarters of UK fulfillment-center staff members were afraid of using the toilet because of time concerns. A report released Monday with the survey's findings said 241 Amazon warehouse employees in England were interviewed.\n\nThe survey anonymously quoted one person as saying targets had \"increased dramatically\" and \"I do not drink water because I do not have time to go to the toilet.\"\n\nAnother said: \"The target grows every year. I do not have two more legs yet to make the 100% to pick, where you actually need to run and go to the toilet just during the break. Packing 120 products per hour is terribly heavy.\n\n\"You have to pack two products per minute. You do not have time to drink water because you go to the toilet after every evening sends messages to the scanner with the target and tells you to hurry.\"\n\nThe survey, compiled by the worker campaign platform Organise, also found that respondents said they felt considerably more anxious after joining Amazon.\n\nWorkers say they have been punished for being sick\n\nAnother employee said she was ill while pregnant and was still given a warning.\n\nAnd yet another said: \"I turned up for my shift even though I felt like s---, managed 2 hours then I just could not do anymore. Told my supervisor and was signed off sick, I had a gastric bug (sickness and diarrhoea, very bad) saw my doc. Got a sick note with an explanation, but still got a strike.\"\n\nAmazon disputed the allegations. The company said in a statement to Business Insider:\n\n\"Amazon provides a safe and positive workplace for thousands of people across the UK with competitive pay and benefits from day one. We have not been provided with confirmation that the people who completed the survey worked at Amazon and we don't recognize these allegations as an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings.\n\n\"We have a focus on ensuring we provide a great environment for all our employees and last month Amazon was named by LinkedIn as the 7th most sought after place to work in the UK and ranked first place in the US. Amazon also offers public tours of its fulfillment centres so customers can see first-hand what happens after they click 'buy' on Amazon.\"\n\nAmazon said it didn't time workers' toilet breaks and set its performance targets based on previous worker performance. The company said it provided coaching to help people improve and used \"proper discretion\" when it came to sick leave and absences from work.\n\nThe company also said it provided on-site occupational health and physiotherapy support as well as legal, financial, and workplace guidance.\n\nIf you worked in an Amazon warehouse and would like to share your horror stories, email in confidence to sghosh@businessinsider.com.",

        "article.text": "Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. Thomson Reuters\n\nPresident Donald Trump has halted the implementation of new Russian sanctions, just one day after United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley said that new sanctions were coming, according to The Washington Post.\n\nOn Sunday, Haley appeared on CBS's \"Face The Nation\" to announce that more economic sanctions on Russia would be initiated on Monday by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin against Russian companies behind the equipment used in an alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria.\n\n\"You will see that Russian sanctions will be coming down,\" Haley said. \"Secretary Mnuchin will be announcing those on Monday, if he hasn't already. And they will go directly to any sort of companies that were dealing with equipment related to Assad and chemical weapons used. And so I think everyone is going to feel it at this point. I think everyone knows that we sent a strong message, and our hope is that they listen to it.\"\n\nPreliminary plans to further punish Russia for its support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his government drew anxiety from the White House. Trump met with national security advisers and expressed disapproval of sanctions being rolled out so quickly when he was not prepared to execute them.\n\nThe newest economic sanctions against Russia were under serious consideration, but had yet to receive final approval from the president. Trump is unlikely to approve additional sanctions against Russia until another triggering event by the Russians.\n\nThe administration characterized Haley's comments as a misstatement and informed the Russian embassy that sanctions were not coming. But some noted to The Post that Haley is extremely cautious and almost always speaks with Trump personally before making public statements.\n\nReports of Trump's disagreement with Haley over new sanctions against Russia come amid a growing number of battles between the president and his administration over policy toward Putin and the Russians.\n\nMembers of Trump's administration have looked to push a more hawkish stance toward Russia, but Trump reportedly remains unconvinced and has told advisers he favors a more cooperative approach toward the Russian government.\n\nTrump reportedly lashed out at aides after the US expelled 60 Russian diplomats last month, and he is also said to have told aides not to speak publicly about tough measures against Russia that he approves because he does not want to upset Putin.",

        "article.text": "The push towards decriminalization comes as the opioid crisis continues to claim thousands of lives on both sides of the 49th parallel\n\nWith months left before Canada becomes the first country in the G7 to fully legalise marijuana, members of the country\u2019s Liberal party, led federally by Justin Trudeau, are calling on their government to go one step further and decriminalise the possession and consumption of all illicit drugs.\n\nThe internal push to embrace the idea is one of more than two dozen resolutions set to be debated this week as the political party gathers for their national convention in the east coast city of Halifax. The resolution is one of three put forward by the national caucus, suggesting widespread support among Liberal MPs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few issues where we\u2019re taught from a young age, that drugs are bad and that it\u2019s normal to throw people in jail for using drugs,\u201d said Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, a Liberal MP who has championed decriminalisation since he was elected in 2015.\n\n\u201cYet when you actually start looking underneath those claims and at the actual evidence and hear from people who have study or lived this issue, this isn\u2019t the right approach.\u201d\n\nCanadian province gambles future on marijuana's 'extreme growth potential' Read more\n\nFraming drug use as a criminal justice issue rather than one of health has simply served to fuel a lucrative black market, divert resources from law enforcement and marginalise those who are often already on the margins of society, he argued.\n\nThe push towards decriminalisation comes as the opioid crisis continues to claim thousands of lives on both sides of the 49th parallel. An estimated 4,000 Canadians died last year due to opioids, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada \u2013 more than the number of Canadians who died due to motor vehicle accidents and homicides combined.\n\nIn British Columbia, the western Canadian province where officials declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in 2016, an average of four people die of overdoses each day.\n\nThe federal Liberal government has taken steps to address the crisis, expediting the approval of supervised injection sites and permitting physicians to prescribe heroin in cases of severe addiction. These are important steps, said Erskine-Smith. \u201cBut obviously if we want to save lives we need to do more.\u201d\n\nThat could mean adopting an idea that is gaining steam across Canada as the number of opioid deaths continue to swell. Earlier this year, Canada\u2019s New Democratic Party became the first major political party in Canada to officially champion the idea.\n\nWeeks later the city of Vancouver recommended that the federal government immediately decriminalise personal possession of illicit drugs. \u201cWe are witnessing a horrific and preventable loss of life as a poisoned drug supply continues to kill our neighbours, friends and family,\u201d Gregor Robertson, Vancouver\u2019s mayor, said in a statement.\n\nTheir stance is backed by prominent organisations, from the Global Commission on Drug Policy to the World Health Organization. Many of them point to the experience of Portugal, which in 2001 did away with criminal penalties for simple possession and consumption of illicit drugs.\n\nThe move was coupled with an expansion of treatment and harm reduction services such as safe injection sites. In Portugal, those caught with drugs appear before dissuasion commissions, which can refer people to treatment or impose monetary fines.\n\nPortugal\u2019s radical drugs policy is working. Why hasn\u2019t the world copied it? Read more\n\nStatistics suggest the approach is working; Portugal has seen dramatic drops in overdose deaths, HIV infection rates and drug-related crimes, while the number of drug users seeking treatment has increased.\n\nShould the Liberals approve their resolution this week, decriminalisation would be backed by two of Canada\u2019s three major parties. But even so, there is little guarantee that the idea will make its way into the Liberal platform in the upcoming 2019 federal election. Trudeau, who leads the party, has repeatedly said his government is not considering legalising any other drugs besides marijuana.\n\nErskine-Smith stressed the difference between the two issues. The federal government\u2019s efforts to end marijuana prohibition aim to halt the flow of profits to organised crime, given that Canadians spent an estimated C$5.7 billion on marijuana last year.\n\nBut when it comes to decriminalisation, said Erskine-Smith, \u201cwe\u2019re not talking removing the criminal sanction for sale, we\u2019re not talking removing the criminal sanction for production, as we did with cannabis.\u201d\n\nThe change in approach comes with political risks, he acknowledged. Canada\u2019s Conservative party remains staunchly opposed to the idea and have shown themselves willing to exploit fears over the proposal to gain votes.\n\nLast year the party\u2019s leader Andrew Scheer attacked Trudeau on Twitter, alleging that his government was considering decriminalisation drugs beside marijuana.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny. When you talk to conservative members of Parliament one-on-one, I think they\u2019re open to the idea,\u201d said Erskine-Smith. \u201cBut my hope is \u2013 especially when confronted with the numbers of Canadians who have lost their lives, and we\u2019re talking Canadians of all backgrounds, Canadians of all political parties \u2013 I really do hope we\u2019re all able to get past the politics of it and follow the evidence.\u201d",

We can't possibly win it.\"\n\nNot all law enforcement experts agree.\n\nFormer WA police commissioner Karl O'Callaghan's son has battled drug addition, and he is worried decriminalising cannabis could trigger or exacerbate mental health problems.\n\n\"They may have an inability to function or work, and I think they're the problems that we should be concerned about when people move to make cannabis more widely available,\" he told AM.\n\n\"They are very significant and trying to get adequate help, even today, without decriminalisation is very, very difficult.\n\n\"I would be concerned that parents would be left with nowhere to turn if the services are not in place as a result of this proposed policy.\"\n\nThe Greens argue tax revenue from cannabis sales would be spent on mental health services, but the party has not specified how much money could be raised or how much would be spent in the sector.\n\nTopics: cannabis, drug-use, government-and-politics, greens, australia\n\nFirst posted",

        "article.text": "Carbon dioxide from ships at sea will be regulated for the first time following a historic agreement reached after two weeks of detailed talks in London.\n\nShipping companies will halve their greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 under the plan, brokered by the International Maritime Organization and binding across its 170 member states.\n\nThe agreement will require a revolution among ships, which are overwhelmingly fuelled by heavy oils at present. In future, they will have to not only be more energy-efficient, but also make use of cleaner energy, in the form of batteries supplying electricity, solar and wind electricity generation, and perhaps even a return to sail in some cases, or more controversially to nuclear power, as some warships already use.\n\nEnvironmental campaigners said the plan was not enough given the urgency of tackling climate change, though they welcomed the deal, which has taken decades of work. Greenhouse gas emissions from shipping and aviation were omitted from the 1997 Kyoto protocol and have been excluded from regulations on carbon ever since, even though shipping is used for 80% of global trade.\n\nAlthough shipping accounts for only about 2% of global carbon emissions, it has been a cause of particular concern, both because of the increased need for transport under the globalising economy and because many ships use dirty, carbon-rich fuels such as heavy diesel, which would be banned in many countries from onshore transport.\n\nCampaigners said cuts of at least 70% from shipping emissions by 2050, compared with the 2008 baseline chosen by the IMO, would be needed to meet the aims of the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, under which countries have agreed that temperature rises should be limited to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nJohn Maggs, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition and senior policy adviser at the campaigning group Seas at Risk, said: \u201cWe have an important agreement and this level of ambition will ultimately require a sector-wide shift to new fuels and propulsion technologies. But what happens next is crucial. The IMO must move swiftly to introduce measures that will cut emissions deeply and quickly in the short term \u2013 without these, the goals of the Paris agreement will remain out of reach.\u201d\n\nSveinung Oftedal, chair of the negotiations at the IMO for the Norwegian government, compared the achievement to the space race, saying: \u201cLike Apollo 11 returning to Earth, we knew we needed to land and we did.\u201d\n\nCountries holding out against a stronger agreement included Brazil, Panama, Saudi Arabia and the US, according to Bill Hemmings, shipping director at Transport & Environment, an NGO. The EU and many Pacific islands were among those pressing for a stronger deal.",

        "article.text": "CBC News has filed a motion to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to force Chevron Corp. to unseal court records in a decades-long environmental battle with approximately 30,000 Indigenous Ecuadorian villagers.\n\nAn appeal hearing in Toronto on Tuesday will continue to hear arguments with significant implications and will raise the question of what responsibility Canadian corporations have for possible harm caused abroad by their corporate affiliates.\n\nThe case, first launched in 1993, has moved through three countries and many courts. The villagers initially alleged years of oil drilling contaminated their water and soil. An Ecuadorian court awarded them $18.2 billion after 18 years; that amount was later reduced to $9.5 billion.\n\nBut Chevron Corp. no longer has assets in Ecuador, so Indigenous groups have taken their fight to other countries including Brazil, Argentina, the United States and now Canada.\n\nPhil Fontaine, a former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, recently visited the Lago Agrio region of Ecuador and says what he saw there was \"devastating.\" He hopes the court will be \"open\" and the Ecuadorian Indigenous people will finally feel \"empowered by the decision.\"\n\nPhil Fontaine, former head of the Assembly of First Nations, recently visited the affected region of Ecuador. He told CBC what he saw there was 'devastating.' (Karen Hinton/Submitted)\n\nThe plaintiffs argue Chevron Canada is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation.\n\nAlan Lenczer, legal counsel for the plaintiffs, said they are entitled to the money. He told CBC News they will continue to argue that Chevron Canada is \"owned\" and \"operated in every material respect\" by their parent company.\n\nChevron is arguing that the case should not move forward because the judgment, originally handed down in Ecuador, was based on fraud and racketeering activities.\n\nChevron Corp. told CBC News they do not believe that the \"fraudulent Ecuadorian judgment is enforceable in any court that observes the rule of law.\" Previously, lawyers have said \"[w]e're going to fight this until Hell freezes over and then fight it out on the ice.\"\n\nLenczner says that the U.S. decision is \"irrelevant\" to what's going on in Canada and \"if they want to undermine the Ecuadorian judgment here in Canada they've got to do it in Canada and they haven't done that yet.\"\n\nChevron, Canada and the CBC\n\nChevron is arguing that Chevron Canada is a distinct entity and not an asset of the parent company and is neither responsible for their debts nor liable to have its assets taken to satisfy such debts.\n\nThe battle made its way all the way up to the Supreme Court of Canada. In 2015 the court affirmed Ontario's jurisdiction over the claim and sent the case back to Ontario Superior Court.\n\nIn January of 2017, Ontario Superior Court Justice Glenn Hainey dismissed the plaintiff's motion on the basis that Chevron Corp. has no assets in Canada and the shares and assets of its indirect subsidiary, Chevron Canada, are not available to pay the judgment.\n\nThe case is in Canada in part because Chevron Corp. no longer has assets in Ecuador. Chevron's lawyers argue Chevron Canada is a separate entity from its parent company, while the plaintiffs argue it is a wholly owned subsidiary. (David Bell/CBC)\n\nMany of the key documents to support Chevron's argument are sealed.\n\n\"Without access to the sealed materials, CBC/Radio-Canada's reporting on the matter will be restricted, and the public may be deprived of important, reliable and direct sources of information on the issues of public interest raised,\" the CBC affidavit states.\n\n\"The issues underlying the proceeding are matters of significant public interest and public importance, including Aboriginal rights in the face of environmental damage caused by private corporations, remediation of environmental damage, and the costs of remediation.\"\n\nFontaine said getting the documents unsealed is important because everyone is entitled to know how corporate interests like Chevron are behaving. He believes their negative behaviour is what is behind their \"closed-book approach.\"\n\nAmazon Watch, Steelworkers Humanity Fund and Friends of the Earth Canada have also filed a joint application to unseal documents stating that \"preventing the public from accessing Chevron's filings violates the principle of open justice.\"\n\nThe CBC motion is scheduled to be heard on June 20, 2018.\n\n25-year legal battle\n\nThe battle began in 1993 when Texaco, which was acquired by Chevron in 2001, was accused by Ecuadorian villagers of water and soil contamination caused by years oil-drilling activities.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Provincial Court awarded the villagers $18.2 billion US judgment in 2011. That amount was later reduced to $9.5 billion US in 2013.\n\nThe energy giant argued the judgment was obtained fraudulently including blackmailing the judge, fabricating evidence and ghostwriting the final ruling.\n\nThe battle moved to the United States, where the federal Court of Appeals agreed with Chevron. The court ruled the judgment was the product of \"egregious fraud\" and racketeering activity, and unenforceable in the United States.\n\n\"Despite attempts by the plaintiff's attorneys and others to shift the discussion to unrelated topics, the question before the court remains whether Chevron Canada Limited can be held liable for a judgment against U.S.-based Chevron Corporation in Ecuador that a U.S. Federal Court has found was the product of corruption and fraud,\" Sean Comey, senior advisor for Chevron Corp. told CBC News.\n\n\"That finding has been unanimously affirmed by a U.S. Federal Court of Appeals and is now final.\"\n\nLarger issues at play\n\nRegardless of the dispute of the Ecuadorian judgement, the plaintiffs and environmental supporters say a bigger issue is at stake.\n\n\"Chevron continues to try to hide everything it can from public scrutiny, but the truth is it can't\n\nhide the evidence of what it did in Ecuador,\" said Paul Paz y Mi\u00f1o, associate director of environmental group Amazon Watch. \"The public needs to see the truth behind Chevron's justice aversion and efforts of impunity abuse of justice.\"\n\nPhil Fontaine, who plans to be at the proceedings in Toronto Tuesday with a large group of supporters, said if the courts rule in favour of the Ecuadorian indigenous interests, the settlement will enable the Indigenous community there to finally recapture some of what they lost -- jobs in agriculture. Those jobs are \"essential for the future wellbeing of those Indigenous communities,\" he said.\n\nBenjamin Zarnett, legal counsel representing Chevron Canada, told CBC News: \"Chevron Canada is looking forward to making its submissions to the Court of Appeal supporting the decision of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice which dismissed this claim against Chevron Canada, against whom the Ecuadorian plaintiffs allege no wrongdoing.\"",

They know that it took clever chemistry to design the PET polymer used in so many billions of bottles and they are delighted to have helped find a way to unpick it. They have grown up with the scourge of plastic pollution and feel highly motivated about trying to tackle it.\n\nYet big challenges lie ahead in turning an ingenious discovery into a real-world application. Developing a technique for producing the enzyme cheaply will be one key hurdle; another will be to harness its power on an industrial scale. But this is an example of accelerated science. A type of bacteria evolved to live off plastic in the last few decades.

It will need to degrade PET faster than its current time of a few days before becoming economically viable as part of the recycling landscape.\n\nProf McGeehan is hopeful that this marks the beginning of a shift in the management of plastics.\n\n\"There is an urgent need to reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfill and the environment, and I think if we can adopt these technologies we actually have a potential solution in the future to doing that\" he added.",

        "article.text": "By David Ingram\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Concern about Facebook Inc\u2019s respect for data privacy is widening to include the information it collects about non-users, after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said the world\u2019s largest social network tracks people whether they have accounts or not.\n\nPrivacy concerns have swamped Facebook since it acknowledged last month that information about millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, a firm that has counted U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 electoral campaign among its clients.\n\nZuckerberg said on Wednesday under questioning by U.S. Representative Ben Luj\u00e1n that, for security reasons, Facebook also collects \u201cdata of people who have not signed up for Facebook.\u201d\n\nLawmakers and privacy advocates immediately protested the practice, with many saying Facebook needed to develop a way for non-users to find out what the company knows about them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to fix that,\u201d Representative Luj\u00e1n, a Democrat, told Zuckerberg, calling for such disclosure, a move that would have unclear effects on the company\u2019s ability to target ads. Zuckerberg did not respond. On Friday Facebook said it had no plans to build such a tool.\n\nCritics said that Zuckerberg has not said enough about the extent and use of the data. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what Facebook is doing with that information,\u201d said Chris Calabrese, vice president for policy at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a Washington advocacy group.\n\nCOOKIES EVERYWHERE\n\nFacebook gets some data on non-users from people on its network, such as when a user uploads email addresses of friends. Other information comes from \u201ccookies,\u201d small files stored via a browser and used by Facebook and others to track people on the internet, sometimes to target them with ads.\n\n\u201cThis kind of data collection is fundamental to how the internet works,\u201d Facebook said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nAsked if people could opt out, Facebook added, \u201cThere are basic things you can do to limit the use of this information for advertising, like using browser or device settings to delete cookies. This would apply to other services beyond Facebook because, as mentioned, it is standard to how the internet works.\u201d\n\nFacebook often installs cookies on non-users\u2019 browsers if they visit sites with Facebook\u201dlike\u201d and \u201cshare\u201d buttons, whether or not a person pushes a button. Facebook said it uses browsing data to create analytics reports, including about traffic to a site.\n\nThe company said it does not use the data to target ads, except those inviting people to join Facebook.\n\nTARGETING FACEBOOK\n\nAdvocates and lawmakers say they are singling out Facebook because of its size, rivaled outside China only by Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google, and because they allege Zuckerberg was not forthcoming about the extent and reasons for the tracking.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s either deliberately misunderstanding some of the questions, or he\u2019s not clear about what\u2019s actually happening inside Facebook\u2019s operation,\u201d said Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a senior staff technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nZuckerberg, for instance, said the collection was done for security purposes, without explaining further or saying whether it was also used for measurement or analytics, Gillmor said, adding that Facebook had a business incentive to use the non-user data to target ads.\n\nFacebook declined to comment on why Zuckerberg referred to security only.\n\nGillmor said Facebook could build databases on non-users by combining web browsing history with uploaded contacts. Facebook said on Friday that it does not do so.\n\nThe ACLU is pushing U.S. lawmakers to enact broad privacy legislation including a requirement for consent prior to data collection.\n\nThe first regulatory challenge to Facebook\u2019s practices for non-users may come next month when a new European Union law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), takes effect and requires notice and consent prior to data collection.\n\nAt a minimum, \u201cFacebook is going to have to think about ways to structure their technology to give that proper notice,\u201d said Woodrow Hartzog, a Northeastern University professor of law and computer science.\n\nFacebook said in its statement on Friday, \u201cOur products and services comply with applicable law and will comply with GDPR.\u201d\n\nThe social network would be wise to recognize at least a right to know, said Michael Froomkin, a University of Miami law professor.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m not a Facebook user, I ought to have a right to know what data Facebook has about me,\u201d Froomkin said.",

It called for more affordable homes for first-time buyers to be built, as well as better protection for those who rent.\n\nAlthough renting is often a reasonable choice for people who have few ties, the private rented sector is \"far less fit for purpose\" for those with children because of a lack of security.\n\nThe report reveals that a record 1.8 million families with children rent privately, up from 600,000 15 years ago.\n\nIt adds that while housing benefit should be able to help millennial families, its value has been reduced relative to the generation who came before them.\n\nLindsay Judge, senior policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \"Britain's housing problems have developed into a full-blown crisis and young people are bearing the brunt - paying a record share of their income on housing in return for living in smaller, rented accommodation.\n\n\"While there have been some steps recently to support housebuilding and first-time buyers, up to a third of millennials still face the prospect of renting from cradle to grave.\n\n\"If we want to tackle Britain's housing crisis we have to improve conditions for the millions of families living in private rented accommodation.

BBC News has set up a new UK Facebook group all about affordable living. Join the Affordable Living group here.\n\nThe report says the tax system should be changed to discourage second home ownership, reducing stamp duty for people who own one home and increasing surcharges for second home owners.\n\nIt also calls for \"light touch\" stabilisation policies to limit rent increases to the rate of inflation over a three-year period.\n\nThe experience of those who rent has become much more important politically as the numbers have increased.\n\nThe accountancy firm PwC predicts that as the price of owning a home rises, 7.2 million households will be in rented accommodation by 2025, compared with 5.4m now and 2.3m in 2001.\n\nThe Labour Party has already proposed a cap on rent increases, along with three-year tenancies and a licensing scheme for landlords.\n\nThe party has also said it will build more council houses.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Buying a house made \"impossible\" by rental costs\n\nThe Liberal Democrats are proposing a \"rent-to-buy\" scheme to help renters purchase the homes they live in, as well as far more shared ownership and social housing.\n\nA Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"Our Help to Buy scheme and the recent cut in stamp duty are helping more young first time buyers get on the property ladder.

        "article.text": "A Syrian soldier inspects the wreckage of a building described as part of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, during a press tour organised by the Syrian information ministry, on 14 April.\n\nInspectors sent to the Damascus suburb where it is claimed up to 75 people were killed as a result of a suspected chemical weapons attack say they have not yet been allowed access to the site by Syria and its close ally Russia, allegedly because of safety concerns.\n\nAhmet \u00dcz\u00fcmc\u00fc, director-general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), said at a meeting of its council on Monday that inspectors on a fact-finding mission to Douma arrived on Saturday, but have yet to begin their work because they have not been allowed access. The OPCW said it was unable to comment further for operational reasons.\n\nIn a news conference in The Hague on Monday, Russian Defence Ministry spokesperson Igor Kirilov said that inspectors would be given access on Wednesday. But western powers have nevertheless accused Russia of intentionally denying access and tampering with evidence.\n\nBritish prime minister Theresa May said there were \"clearly attempts\" by Syria and Russia to block any proper investigation into the attack.\n\n\"Even if the OPCW team is able to visit Douma to gather information to make that assessment \u2013 and they are currently being prevented from doing so by the regime and the Russians \u2013 it cannot attribute responsibility,\" she told MPs on Monday.\n\n\"This is because Russia vetoed in November 2017 an extension of the joint investigatory mechanism set up to do this. And last week, in the wake of the Douma attack, it again vetoed a new UNSC [United Nations Security Council] resolution to re-establish such a mechanism.\"\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn also said it was \"vitally important\" for the OPCW inspectors to be allowed access to the site. But he criticised May for ordering the RAF to join US and French air strikes on Saturday.\n\n\"The Prime Minister is accountable to this parliament, not to the whims of the US president,\" he said. \"We clearly need a War Powers Act in this country to transform a now broken convention into a legal obligation.\"\n\nRussian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said, according to an AP report, that the weapons inspectors had not been allowed in because it hadn't got approval from the UN's Department of Safety and Security.\n\nBut a spokesperson for the UN told Reuters that this was not the case and that the OPCW did not require security clearance.\n\n\"The United Nations has provided the necessary clearances for the OPCW team to go about its work in Douma. We have not denied the team any request for it to go to Douma,\" they said.",

Attackers also sought to undermine the firewalls and intrusion detection systems organisations used to spot malicious traffic before it reached users.\n\nAnalysis\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nBy Gordon Corera, Security correspondent\n\nIt is possible that Russian intrusions may be increasing. But it is too early to know for sure if this is the case, since it takes time to spot this - if it is spotted at all - and to be sure it is Russian.\n\nThe crucial thing is whether Russia actually employs its offensive capability to actually do something destructive.\n\nSo far, there has been relatively little sign of this in the US or UK, although Russia is accused of launching destructive attacks against Ukraine.\n\nIt is worth saying that Britain and the US will be carrying out almost identical activities in Russia, pre-positioning in Russian networks to be able to respond.\n\nWhat no-one is quite sure of is whether this creates a deterrent a bit like mutually assured nuclear destruction in the Cold War.\n\nRead Gordon's full blog\n\nIn addition, Mr Joyce said, many different organisations had come under attack for months at a time in a bid to scoop up valuable intellectual property, business information or to get at their customers.\n\n\"When we see malicious cyber-activity, whether Kremlin or other nation state actors, we are going to push back,\" said Mr Joyce.\n\nCiaran Martin, head of the UK's NCSC, said the issuing of the alert marked a \"significant moment\" as the two powers had never before given joint advice on how to deal with attacks.\n\n\"Many of the techniques used by Russia exploit basic weaknesses in network systems,\" said Mr Martin.\n\nThe principal targets of the global campaign were internet service providers, firms running critical infrastructure, government departments and large companies, the alert stated.\n\nAnd it contained detailed information about attack methods, the signs left when hardware has been compromised, and how networks change when they have been breached.\n\nThe advice given to firms has included ways to configure their systems correctly and how to apply patches to address hardware vulnerabilities.\n\nMr Martin said GCHQ, NCSC's parent organisation, had tracked the threat posed by Russian cyber-gangs for more than 20 years. Further intelligence about the attacks had been added by \"multiple\" cyber-security organisations and companies, he added.\n\nThe UK was working with America, its other allies and the technology industry to \"expose Russia's unacceptable cyber-behaviour, so they are held accountable for their actions\", said Mr Martin.",

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/Pool/File Photo\n\nNone of the world\u2019s major encrypted messaging apps, including Facebook\u2019s (FB.O) WhatsApp and Telegram - a favorite of President Emmanuel Macron - are based in France, raising the risk of data breaches at servers outside the country.\n\nAbout 20 officials and top civil servants are testing the new app which a state-employed developer has designed, a ministry spokeswoman said, with the aim that its use will become mandatory for the whole government by the summer.\n\n\u201cWe need to find a way to have an encrypted messaging service that is not encrypted by the United States or Russia,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cYou start thinking about the potential breaches that could happen, as we saw with Facebook, so we should take the lead.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. social network, which bought WhatsApp in 2014, has drawn heavy criticism since it acknowledged that information about many millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe French government\u2019s encrypted app has been developed on the basis of free-to-use code found on the Internet and could be eventually made available to all citizens, the spokeswoman said. She declined to give the names of either the codes or the messaging service.\n\nFOND OF TELEGRAM\n\nMacron\u2019s inner circle - now government advisers or ministers - have grown fond of the Telegram app, which they used to plot his rise to power and his presidential election campaign last year.\n\nMacron, an economy minister in the previous Socialist administration, wanted at the time to use an encrypted messaging service that even his rivals in the last government could not crack, a close adviser to Macron told Reuters.\n\nSince then, most of his lawmakers have joined the app and the president himself can often be seen online on Telegram, sometimes in the early hours of the morning..\n\nBut privacy concerns started growing earlier this year, and security tools from French security firm Thales (TCFP.PA) installed on officials\u2019 work smartphones prevented the use of either WhatsApp or Telegram.\n\nTelegram was set up by a Russian entrepreneur who has come into conflict with the authorities. Russia\u2019s state telecommunications regulator said on Monday it had begun blocking access to Telegram after the company refused to comply with an order to give state security access to its users\u2019 secret messages.\n\nBoth WhatsApp and Telegram promote themselves as ultra secure because all their data is encrypted from start to finish.

After taking power in 2017, the provincial government of British Columbia \u2013 a left-leaning coalition which relies on support from the Green Party \u2013 vowed to use all the tools available to them to halt the project.\n\nRecent weeks have seen indigenous-led protests against the project heat up, sending thousands into the streets. About 200 people have been arrested for blocking the entrance of facility belonging to Trans Mountain, including two federal MPs.\n\nOn Sunday, Trudeau interrupted a foreign trip to meet the premiers of Alberta and British Columbia, reiterating his government\u2019s determination to see the project completed. \u201cThe Trans Mountain expansion is a vital strategic interest to Canada \u2212 it will be built,\u201d he told reporters after the meeting.\n\nThe prime minister said the project \u2013 which would nearly triple the flow of Alberta\u2019s bitumen to the west coast \u2013 is in the national interest. \u201cIt means good jobs in Alberta, they\u2019ve suffered tough times. It means good jobs in BC, thousands of them as the pipeline is built.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty looming over trade relations between Canada and the US as well as waning investor confidence in Canada\u2019s ability to complete big projects reinforce why this expansion needs to go forward, he added.\n\nTrudeau said his government would launch formal financial discussions with Kinder Morgan and potentially use taxpayer dollars to ensure the project goes forward.

        "article.text": "LONDON/NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The United States has banned American firms from selling parts and software to China\u2019s ZTE Corp for seven years, potentially devastating for the telecoms equipment maker and exacerbating tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nThe move, first reported by Reuters, comes at a time when the two countries have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars in tariffs in recent weeks, fanning worries of a full blown trade war that threatens global supply chains as well as business investment plans.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department imposed the ban following ZTE\u2019s violation of an agreement on punishing employees that was reached after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran.\n\nChina responded swiftly, warning it is prepared to take action to protect the interests of Chinese firms and saying it hopes the United States can deal with the issue in accordance with the law.\n\nThe U.S. action could be catastrophic for ZTE since American companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE\u2019s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks.\n\n\u201cIf the issue cannot be solved smoothly and immediately, we think that ZTE will face tremendous disaster and would be forced to scale back on its smartphone business, not only in the U.S., but also in other markets,\u201d said Strategy Analytics analyst Woody Oh.\n\nZTE, whose Hong Kong and Shenzhen shares were suspended from trade on Tuesday, said in a statement it was assessing the implications of the U.S. decision and was communicating with \u201crelevant parties\u201d.\n\nThe company has set up a crisis management group in response to the ban, said a ZTE source, declining to be identified as the information was confidential.\n\nParticularly damaging, Google\u2019s mobile services including the Google Play App Store are likely to be covered by the ban even though the Android operating system is free, said Richard Windsor, an independent analyst at Radio Free Mobile.\n\n\u201cI think that there is a risk that ZTE loses all of its non-Chinese Android business,\u201d he said. \u201cIn almost every region outside of China, it is almost impossible to sell an Android handset that does not have Google Play installed.\u201d\n\nGoogle declined to comment.\n\nZTE is China\u2019s No. 2 telecom equipment maker after Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], the No. 4 seller of smartphones in the United States, and was worth some $20 billion as of Monday\u2019s close. In 2017, it derived 59 percent of revenue from its network business and 32 percent from its consumer business.\n\n\u201cIf the company is not able to resolve it, they may very well be put out of business by this. Many banks and companies even outside the U.S. are not going to want to deal with them,\u201d said Eric Hirschhorn, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce who was heavily involved in the case.\n\nThe Chinese company paid $890 million in fines and penalties after it pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Shenzhen-based ZTE promised to dismiss four senior employees and discipline 35 others by either reducing their bonuses or reprimanding them, senior U.S. officials told Reuters.\n\nBut the Chinese company admitted in March that while it had fired the four senior employees, it had not disciplined or reduced bonuses to the 35 others.\n\nFLASHPOINT SECTOR\n\nSaying ZTE was likely to miss shipments and lose orders, brokerage Jefferies downgraded its rating on the firm to \u2018underperform\u2019 from \u2018buy\u2019 and slashed its price target to HK$15.72, nearly 40 percent below the firm\u2019s closing price prior to Tuesday\u2019s trading halt.\n\nVisitors are seen at a booth of Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp at an expo in Beijing, China, September 27, 2017. Picture taken September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nBut Jefferies also said it expected ZTE would be able to settle with U.S. authorities in three to five months.\n\nUnder terms of the ban, U.S. companies cannot export prohibited goods, such as chip sets, directly to ZTE or via another country, beginning immediately.\n\nAs U.S. concerns about safeguarding its chip technology and cutting its trade deficit grow, the tech sector has become a flashpoint in the broader battle about trade and economic policy, with U.S. President Donald Trump accusing Chinese firms of intellectual property theft for years.\n\nWashington has also deepened its scrutiny of Chinese investment in the U.S., with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), blocking many proposed acquisitions of U.S. assets by Chinese companies.\n\nPiling further pressure on ZTE, Britain\u2019s main cyber security agency said on Monday it has written to organizations in the UK\u2019s telecommunications sector warning about using services or equipment from ZTE.\n\nThe ban on supplying ZTE comes two months after two Republican senators introduced legislation to block the U.S. government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from ZTE or Huawei, citing concern the companies would use their access to spy on U.S. officials.\n\n\u201cChina does not play by our rules, and we must be vigilant against Chinese threats to both our economic security and national security,\u201d said Republican Representative Robert Pittenger after the Commerce announcement. Pittenger is sponsoring legislation that would strengthen the U.S. national security review process for foreign investments.\n\nU.S. firms are also likely to get caught in the crossfire, with the fallout set to hit Qualcomm Inc, which provides the lion\u2019s share of chips inside ZTE smartphones. Qualcomm was not immediately available to comment.\n\nShares in optical networking equipment maker Acacia Communications Inc, which gained just under a third of its total 2017 revenue from ZTE, tumbled 35 percent. Acacia said it was suspending affected transactions and assessing the impact.\n\nOther optical component companies also slid, with Lumentum Holdings Inc falling 8.9 percent and Finisar Corp dropping 4 percent. Oclaro Inc, which got 18 percent of its fiscal 2017 revenue from ZTE, lost 14 percent.\n\nVisitors pass in front of the Chinese telecoms equipment group ZTE Corp booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2018.

Try another or register with your social account\n\nA report prepared as part of the police investigation into the Grenfell Tower fire has uncovered calamitous deficiencies in the installation of the windows, cavity barriers and cladding system, and their failure to meet building regulations.\n\nThe 210-page interim document, by fire investigation experts BRE Global, is set to dramatically assist the Metropolitan police in their wide-ranging investigation. It was leaked exclusively to the Standard and recounts in forensic detail how the original concrete building was turned from a safe structure into a tinderbox by the refurbishment between 2014 and 2016.\n\nIt not only finds the cladding material and insulation was combustible, but also exposes hitherto unknown areas of incompetence relating to the design and installation of the windows and cavity barriers. The latter are critical in closing the gap between the inner and outer skins of the building to prevent a chimney-like effect in the event of a blaze.\n\nIt reveals how in the early hours of June 14 last year, the fire started in a single fridge-freezer in a single flat on the fourth floor; travelled through an open window within a metre of the fridge; took hold in the cladding; and consumed an entire 24-storey, 70-metre-high building. A total of 71 lives were lost.\n\nVictims of the Grenfell Tower fire 32 show all Victims of the Grenfell Tower fire 1/32 Final death toll: Just some of the victims who were killed in the Grenfell Tower blaze PA 2/32 Final death toll: Just some of the victims who were killed in the Grenfell Tower blaze 3/32 Five-year-old Isaac Paulos Family Handout 4/32 Victoria King, 71, and her 40-year-old daughter Alexandra Atala were among those who died in the blaze PA 5/32 Alexandra Atala, 40, the last victim to be named and pictured from the Grenfell fire Metropolitan Police 6/32 Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi 7/32 Rania Ibrahim and her two daughters 8/32 Raymond Bernard 9/32 Nadia Choucair 10/32 Grenfell victims: father and daughter Hashim Kedir, 44, and Firdows Hashim, 12, PA 11/32 Mehdi El-Wahabi, 8, lived on the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower Met Police 12/32 Ligaya Moore, 79, a Filipino living in the tower Met Police 13/32 Artist Khadija Saye PA 14/32 Victim: 12-year-old Jessica Urbano Ramirez was killed in the fire 15/32 Victim: Farah Hamdan, 31, pictured with her baby daughter 16/32 Mohamednur Tuccu PA 17/32 Biruk Haftom, 12, has been named among those who died in the Grenfell Tower fire Metropolitan Police 18/32 Grenfell: Biruk's mother, Berkti Haftom, 29, also died in the blaze Metropolitan Police 19/32 Victim: Sakina Afrasehabi, 65, died in the Grenfell Tower fire PA 20/32 Fatima Afraseiabi 21/32 'Well respected': Grandmother-of-six Sheila Smith was killed in the Grenfell Tower blaze Met Police 22/32 Hamid Kani was found on the 23rd floor PA 23/32 Steve Power 24/32 Mohammed Al-Haj Ali Syrian Solidarity Campaign 25/32 Denis Murphy PA 26/32 Young victim: Jeremiah Deen, two, died in the blaze Met Police 27/32 Zainab Deen 28/32 Tony Disson 29/32 Mariem Elgwahry PA 30/32 Ali Yawar Jafari PA 31/32 Nora Huda 32/32 Kedir Hashim: His wife and their three children died\n\nFor the first time, the truth of how the refurbishment fell short of building regulations, and allowed a catastrophe to happen, is laid bare.\n\nThe first conclusion of the report is that the fire would not have spread beyond Flat 16 \u2014 the flat of origin \u2014 and would not have claimed even a single life if the original facade of the building had not been re-clad.\n\nIt states that the 2014-16 refurbishment failed, in several fundamental areas, to meet fire safety standards set out in the building regulations \u2014 known as Approved Document B. Taken together, these areas proved critical for the rapid spread of flames across the length and breadth of the building.\n\nThe report, dated 31 January 2018, says: \u201cGrenfell Tower, as originally built, appears to have been designed on the premise of providing very high levels of passive fire protection.\n\n\u201cThe original facade of Grenfell Tower, comprising exposed concrete and, given its age, likely timber or metal frame windows, would not have provided a medium for fire spread up the external surface. In BRE\u2019s opinion \u2026 there would have been little opportunity for a fire in a flat of Grenfell Tower to spread to any neighbouring flats.\u201d\n\nThe experts found instead that \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in the construction of the new facade provided fuel for the fire to spread \u2014 and that it did so with such ferocity that if the original building had been built to less stringent modern standards of fire resistance, \u201cit is likely the Tower would have collapsed, whether fully or partially\u201d. The report identifies five significant breaches of building regulations that appear directly implicated in the loss of life:\n\nGaps that fanned fire\n\nThe cavity barriers \u2014 which in the event of fire are meant to expand and seal the gap between the concrete surface of the building and the cladding insulation \u2014 were of \u201cinsufficient size specification\u201d to perform this vital function.\n\nSome cavity barriers were installed \u201cupside down\u201d or \u201cback to front\u201d, further retarding their effectiveness.\n\nThey were \u201cdesigned to close a gap of 25mm\u201d, but the actual gap \u201cmeasured up to 50mm\u201d.\n\nThe result was to create a catastrophic chimney-like effect in the gap between the cladding and the concrete surface that \u201cprovided a route for fire spread\u201d.\n\nWindow frames that helped flames spread\n\nThe window frames were \u201csignificantly narrower than the gap between the concrete surfaces of the columns, 150mm narrower\u201d, leaving large gaps at either end.\n\nThese spaces were filled by a rubberised membrane, rigid foam insulation and uPVC lightweight plastic panels \u2014 but crucially \u201cnone of the materials used would be capable of providing 30 minutes fire resistance\u201d.\n\nThe result was \u201ca direct route for fire spread around the window frame into the cavity of the facade \u2026 and from the facade back into flats\u201d.\n\nThis has added importance, as the first obstacle the fire encountered as it escaped from Flat 16 was the window frame which provided \u201cfuel\u201d instead of a barrier. BRE says: \u201cThe construction of the window did not provide any substantial barrier to fire taking hold on the facade outside.\u201d\n\nKey pages from leaked Grenfell Tower report - In pictures 13 show all Key pages from leaked Grenfell Tower report - In pictures 1/13 01 2/13 02 3/13 03 4/13 04 5/13 05 6/13 06 7/13 07 8/13 08 9/13 09 10/13 10 11/13 11 12/13 12 13/13 13\n\nCombustible insulation\n\nThe insulation used was \u201ccombustible\u201d and \u201cprovided a medium for fire spread up, across and within sections of the facade\u201d.\n\nBRE notes that the 75mm insulation foam used on most of the spandrel beams had \u201cno markings to identify the manufacturer of the foam\u201d, unlike the 100mm Celotex foam insulation used on the columns. BRE records this oddity of the mystery manufacturer but does not further distinguish between the foam types, concluding both were \u201ccombustible\u201d.\n\nFlammable core\n\nThe aluminium composite material used in the facade had a polyethylene (plastic) core that \u201cappears to be highly combustible\u201d and \u201cappears to have provided a medium for fire spread up and across the facade\u201d.\n\nLack of door closers\n\nThe \u201cabsence of door closers\u201d on many front doors to flats, contrary to building regulations, resulted in a significant number of doors being inadvertently left open when residents fled.\n\n\u201cWhere this occurred, the fire in each flat appears to have emitted large quantities of smoke and later fire directly into the immediate lobby, and these have gone on to affect the lifts and single stairwell\u201d.\n\nThis is a major failing because it created \u201cshortcomings in compartmentation\u201d of the fire and would have affected residents\u2019 life chances as they sought to escape down the single stairwell.\n\nBRE notes that individual breaches relating to the cladding system assume far greater importance when \u201cconsidered in combination as opposed to when they occur in isolation\u201d.\n\nFirefighting weaknesses\n\nFirefighting facilities were \u201cdeficient\u201d, hampered by poor access and lack of installation of a wet rising main.\n\nThere was room for just \u201ca single fire engine\u201d on the hard standing at the base of the east side of the tower, as other sides of the tower were not accessible due to landscaping. This single fire engine would be \u201cunlikely to provide sufficient pressure and flow of water for firefighting at the top of the tower\u201d using the dry rising main.\n\nThe report says: \u201cA building of Grenfell\u2019s height ought to have been fitted with a wet rising main [which contains water at all times] as part of the refurbishment; instead the existing dry rising main [which has to be supplied from a fire engine] was extended and modified.\u201d BRE cites two other breaches of building regulations \u2014 the absence of a sprinkler system and the single stairwell being 8cm too narrow. However it does not necessarily regard these weaknesses as directly responsible for loss of life. It adds that the stairwell would have been \u201cdifficult and expensive to change as part of any refurbishment\u201d.\n\nNotting Hill Grenfell Tower Fire - In pictures 37 show all Notting Hill Grenfell Tower Fire - In pictures 1/37 A blaze rages through Grenfell Tower block in Notting Hill Jeremy Selwyn 2/37 Aerial view of the fire at Grenfell Tower, Notting Hill Jason Hawkes 3/37 Jeremy Selwyn 4/37 Aerial view of the fire at Grenfell Tower, Notting Hill Jason Hawkes 5/37 Jeremy Selwyn 6/37 A firefighter investigates a floor after a fire engulfed the 24-storey Grenfell Tower PA 7/37 Exhausted firefighter rest on steps of houses after ours of tackling the blaze Alex Lentati 8/37 Jeremy Selwyn 9/37 10/37 Residents wave frantically at a window during the blaze Nigel Howard 11/37 Emergency personnel operate during the fire at the Grenfell Tower, a 27-storey apartment block in North Kensington, London EPA 12/37 A police officer helps to evacuate a local resident from close to the scene of a serious fire in a tower block at Latimer Road in West London Reuters 13/37 Debris and ash surrounding Grenfell Tower in the West Lancaster estate, Latimer road Jeremy Selwyn 14/37 A fleet of ambulances at the scene ready to deal with the injured AFP/Getty Images 15/37 A firefighter rests during the battle against the blaze at Grenfell Tower Jeremy Selwyn 16/37 Firefighters prepare to enter the building to tackle the flames EPA 17/37 Nigel Howard 18/37 Smoke billows from a fire that has engulfed the 24-storey Grenfell Tower in west London PA 19/37 Flames engulf the tower block in Notting Hill AFP/Getty Images 20/37 This shocking image shows flames engulfing the 27 storey tower Jeremy Selwyn 21/37 Police and Emergency services at the scene of a major fire in Notting Hill after a block of flats Grenfell Tower is engulfed in flames Nigel Howard 22/37 A person peers out of a window from the building on fire in London AP 23/37 Firefighters react as a huge fire engulfs the Grenfell Tower AFP/Getty Images 24/37 Smoke rises from the fire at the Grenfell Tower, a 24-storey apartment block in North Kensington, London EPA 25/37 Smoke billows across the London skyline follwing a fire at Grenfell Tower in the West Lancaster estate Alex Lentati 26/37 Aw omen react followign the blaze at Grenfell Tower Alex Lentati 27/37 Smoke billows across the London skyline follwing a fire at Grenfell Tower in the West Lancaster estate Jeremy Selwyn 28/37 A water jet douses the fire at the Grenfell Tower, a 24-storey apartment block seen through a fence in North Kensington EPA 29/37 Young children wear protective face masks near the burning 24 storey residential Grenfell Tower block in Latimer Road, West London Getty Images 30/37 Two men hug within the security cordon as Grenfell Tower is engulfed by fire AFP/Getty Images 31/37 A man (circled) looks from a window as smoke pours from a fire that has engulfed the 27-storey Grenfell Tower PA 32/37 Smoke billows across the London skyline follwing a fire at Grenfell Tower in the West Lancaster estate Alex Lentati 33/37 Firefighters on the scene at Grenfell Tower on Latimer Road early this morning Alex Lentati 34/37 A view of debris from the Grenfell Tower fire covering a football pitch EPA 35/37 Aerial view of the closed of Westway follwing a the fire at Grenfell Tower in the West Lancaster estate, Latimer Road.

BRE was asked to achieve three aims:\n\n\u201cTo establish the circumstances surrounding as many deaths resulting from the fire as possible;\u201d\n\n\u201cTo establish any failings of duty of care owed to victims of the fire, both fatalities and surviving residents;\u201d\n\n\u201cTo provide expert witness support in relation to any criminal prosecution, public inquiry or inquest.\u201d\n\nThe Standard understands, from a separate source, that the police investigation has already downloaded over 30 million emails and documents from the servers of Kensington and Chelsea council and the Tenant Management Organisation, and that they are beginning to trace and interview about 500 key contractors and sub-contractors involved in the refurbishment.\n\nThe on-site work that formed the basis for the report involved fingertip searches and the examination of all 129 flats, and was scheduled to run until the end of March. Evaluations of the condition of each flat on the fourth, fifth, sixth and 23rd floors are in this draft \u2014 with the \u201cdamage overview\u201d ranging from \u201ctotal destruction\u201d to \u201cundamaged\u201d.\n\nReports on flats on other floors were still being drafted. Further tests of the fire resistance of doors and lifts, and safety of gas installation, were still being carried out at the date of the draft.\n\nThe report could also feed into the public inquiry, due to start on May 21.\n\nA specialist architect shown the document said: \u201cThe question is: could this fire have been avoided? This damning report is saying it absolutely could have been and that the refurb was to blame.\n\n\u201cConstruction around the cavity barriers and windows was particularly poor. The uPVC used in the panels to close the gap around the windows was a terrible mistake. It has no fire integrity and provided a vulnerable route for fire to spread.\n\n\u201cThese findings could result in people going to prison. But the report has left open the vital question as to whether the design or the installation was at fault, whether the works were approved and/or inspected, or whether it was a combination of all of these.\n\n\u201cThe buck stops with the owner of the building Kensington and Chelsea council, and its management organisation, which have ultimate duty of care. Some people will not be sleeping well at night once this report is made public. You read it and think: heads are going to roll.\u201d\n\nBuilding Research Establishment is a former government laboratory that was privatised in 1997 and is now owned by charitable organisation BRE Trust. Based in Watford, it provides research, testing, certification and standards.\n\nA Kensington and Chelsea Council spokesperson said: \u201cWe think the public inquiry and the police investigation are the right places for testing all the evidence as a whole. The Council is clear \u2013 we have handed over thousands of documents \u2013 we are committed to finding the truth. We hope full disclosure of all the evidence, tested by the inquiry judge, will deliver the answers to ensure this never happens again.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for survivor group Grenfell United \"The report in the Evening Standard is shocking but it is not surprising to those of us that lived in the tower. It was clear to us the refurbishment was shoddy and second rate. We raised concerns time and time again. We were not just ignored but bullied to keep quiet.\n\n\"That a refurbishment could make our homes dangerous and unsafe shows that the contractors put profit before lives. It's an industry that is broken.\n\n\"It's also an industry that has been allowed to get away with this behaviour. Six people died in a fire at Lakanal House in 2009 and the Government failed to act and make changes to regulations that would have stopped a fire like that happening again. Tonight we know people are going to sleep in homes with dangerous cladding on them.\n\n\"It is vital the police investigation and the public Inquiry uncover everything that led to the fire and that the Government now actually act so that this can never happen again.\u201d",

        "article.text": "(TAMPA, Fla.) \u2014 Her friends say the last they saw of her was when commandos intercepted their sailboat in the Arabian Sea and dragged her away, kicking and screaming. A daughter of Dubai\u2019s ruler, she had been trying to escape her homeland, saying she was being abused.\n\nSince then, the whereabouts of Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum are unknown, though she was likely brought back to the United Arab Emirates after the commando raid last month, said Herve Jaubert, a French ex-spy who told The Associated Press that he helped organize her escape attempt.\n\nDubai\u2019s government and Emirati officials did not respond to AP requests for comment.\n\n\u201cI know it sounds incredible,\u201d Jaubert told the AP, but \u201cit\u2019s just the facts.\u201d\n\nThe allegations of a dramatic would-be sea escape intrude into the carefully controlled image maintained by the family of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who not only rules Dubai but is the Emirates\u2019 prime minister and vice president. He is believed to have several dozen children from multiple wives. Some of his sons and daughters figure prominently in local media and online, but others are rarely seen.\n\nSheikh Mohammed has multiple daughters named Latifa. In recent weeks, one of those Latifas has suddenly appeared frequently in media. The appearances could be an attempt to muddy the picture as local media now make no mention of the Latifa who allegedly tried to leave.\n\nMatters have since grown only murkier. A London-based for-hire advocacy group long critical of the UAE, called Detained in Dubai, has been promoting the case and says it has targeted by threats.\n\nAll this takes place against the backdrop of a Gulf-wide misinformation war linked to a diplomatic dispute between typically clubby Arab nations and Qatar. The UAE and its allies Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt have boycotted Qatar since June. Each side has spread critical \u2014 or false \u2014 reports about the other; millions of dollars have been spent by all involved on public relations campaigns and lobbyists.\n\nThat, coupled with Jaubert\u2019s own flair for the dramatic, makes discerning what happened that much more complicated.\n\nJaubert himself fled the UAE years earlier because of a financial dispute in a cloak-and-dagger escape that he said involved disguising himself as a woman and scuba diving to escape to international waters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Herve, that\u2019s the problem. He tells you what he wants to tell you to get you to do what he wants you to do,\u201d said Kathryn Heathcock, a lawyer based in Stuart, Florida, who had Jaubert as a client. \u201cThat\u2019s your training when you\u2019re an agent. That\u2019s what they do.\u201d\n\nJaubert, a former agent of the French DGSE spy agency, first came to the UAE in 2004 as part of a plan to build submarines for the wealthy in a project by Dubai World, a government-owned conglomerate. It was one of a number of luxury projects during a period of feverish development in Dubai.\n\nDubai World collapsed in the emirates\u2019 2009 financial crisis, which saw a number of foreigners flee unpaid debts in a nation where debtors face prison time.\n\nFacing financial problems and what he described as threats from authorities, Jaubert said he escaped by wearing a woman\u2019s all-enveloping burqa over scuba gear to reach a raft, then met a waiting sailboat in international waters.\n\nThe 2010 book he wrote, \u201cEscape from Dubai,\u201d prompted Sheikha Latifa to contact him, he said.\n\n\u201cShe said who she was and I was extremely careful,\u201d Jaubert said. \u201cI was looking for a trap.\u201d He said he confirmed her identity through \u201csurveillance,\u201d without elaborating.\n\nIt took eight years for Sheikha Latifa to decide to flee, he said.\n\nBoth Jaubert and the sheikha made calls and sent emails at the start of March, seeking political asylum for her in the U.S., said Heathcock, an immigration lawyer. Another Florida lawyer, Linda Braswell, also said she was aware of Jaubert\u2019s efforts on the sheikha\u2019s behalf.\n\nSheikha Latifa, who is in her early 30s, appears in a 40-minute video in which she says she\u2019s making the testimony just before the escape attempt to be released in case it fails.\n\nIn it, she says that on orders of her father she was imprisoned off and on for several years and abused after trying to leave the Emirates. She says that she was later released but kept under heavy restrictions on her movement.\n\nShe gave Jaubert and lawyers the video, as well as pictures of an Emirati passport and an Emirati ID card identifying her as a member of the Dubai ruling family. Detained in Dubai later received the video to release if the escape went wrong.\n\nIn the video, Sheikha Latifa talks of her skydiving hobby. Kristen Cotten, a 33-year-old skydive instructor and friend of Sheikha Latifa, told the AP the woman in the video and the identification documents is indeed her friend.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people think it\u2019s fake just because it sounds so crazy,\u201d said Cotten, who was an instructor in Dubai between 2012 and 2016 and now lives in Minnesota.\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t worked with her and known her and seen her every day I\u2019d probably feel the same way. But that\u2019s the same girl I saw every day at the drop zone.\u201d\n\nSheikha Latifa also was shown and identified in pictures from 2016 and 2017 on an Instagram account connected to her skydiving club. Past articles in state-linked media also confirm she is a daughter of the ruler.\n\nAided by friend Tiina Jauhiainen, the sheikha made it into neighboring Oman and then took a small boat out to meet Jaubert and his crew aboard his U.S.-flagged sailboat, the Nostromo, the former spy said.\n\nThe Nostromo sailed for the Indian coast, but three Indian and two Emirati warships intercepted it on March 4, Jaubert said. A team of commandos boarded the boat in the Arabian Sea some 380 kilometers (235 miles) southwest of Mumbai, according to Jaubert and Detained in Dubai.\n\nJaubert said the Indian commandos beat him and his crew.\n\n\u201cIf you do anything, they are going to vaporize you,\u201d he said.\n\nIndian officials told the AP they had no information about the incident Jaubert described.\n\nJauhiainen, speaking at a news conference Thursday in London, said Sheikha Latifa kept repeating during the raid: \u201cI am seeking political asylum.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt that time I was told to keep my eyes shut, with a threat to be shot if I didn\u2019t comply,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I heard someone speaking Arabic and Latifa said: \u2018Shoot me here, just don\u2019t take me back to the UAE.'\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was taken away kicking and screaming.\u201d\n\nThe Emirati forces took the Nostromo back to a naval base in Fujairah, one of the UAE\u2019s seven emirates, Jaubert said.\n\nThe Nostromo\u2019s Maritime Mobile Service Identity number, a nine-digit code broadcast by radio that identifies a ship at sea, showed the vessel in Fujairah on March 20, said Georgios Hatzimanolis, a spokesman for the ship-tracking website MarineTraffic.com.\n\nDetained in Dubai released Sheikha Latifa\u2019s video and began a social media campaign calling for their release. Jaubert credited that for leading the Emiratis, who fed and treated him well but refused him access to a lawyer or consular official, to release him and Jauhiainen.\n\nBoth say they last saw Latifa being forced off the Nostromo onto one of the warships. But it remains unclear what has happened to her since. Messages sent by the AP to emails and telephone numbers associated with her have gone unanswered.",

        "article.text": "The US and British governments on Monday accused Russia of conducting a massive campaign to compromise computer routers and firewalls around the world - from home offices to Internet providers \u2013 for espionage and possibly sabotage purposes.\n\nThe unusual public warning from the White House, US agencies and Britain's National Cyber Security Center follows a years-long effort to monitor the threat.\n\nThe targets number in the millions, officials say, and include \"primarily government and private-sector organizations, critical infrastructure providers, and the Internet service providers (ISPs) supporting these sectors.\"\n\nIt was the two countries' first such joint alert.\n\n\"We have high confidence that Russia has carried out a coordinated campaign to compromise . . . routers, residential and business - the things you and I have in our home,\" said Rob Joyce, the White House cybersecurity coordinator.\n\n\"We condemn the actions and hold the Kremlin responsible for the malicious activities,\" said Jeanette Manfra, the chief cybersecurity official for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe warning is unrelated to the administration's recent military strikes on suspected chemical weapons facilities in Syria, action Russia condemned.\n\nRather, it is part of a broader ongoing effort by the US government to call out bad behavior in cyberspace and impose costs as a deterrent.\n\n\"When we see malicious cyber activity, whether it be from the Kremlin or other malicious actors, we're going to push back,\" Joyce said.\n\nMonday's announcement is the latest in a series of related moves by the Trump administration, which in recent months has publicly blamed Russia for launching the NotPetya worm that has been characterized as the costliest and most destructive cyberattack in history.\n\nIt also recently announced that Russia had targeted the US energy grid with computer malware, and it slapped fresh sanctions on Russian hackers for illicit cyber activity.\n\nThe US government also has obtained indictments against Iranian hackers, and accused North Korea of being behind the WannaCry computer worm that affected more than 230,000 computers around the world.\n\nThe US and British governments jointly tracked the latest campaign, which has targeted millions of machines globally, said Ciaran Martin, chief executive of Britain's NCSC, the government's central cybersecurity agency.\n\nThe aim seems to be to \"seize control\" of the machines that connect networks to the Internet, and in the case of Internet providers, to gain access to their customers, for espionage or other purposes, he said.\n\nThese network devices make \"ideal targets\", said Manfra, Homeland Security's assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications.\n\nMost traffic within a company or between organizations traverses them. So a hacker can monitor, modify or disrupt it, she said.

        "article.text": "In this artist's sketch, Bruce McArthur, facing several murder charges, makes an appearance via video in a Toronto courtroom, Wednesday, April 11, 2018. Police have trying to identify the remains of several men found at a property McArthur used as storage for his landscaping business and say he targeted men he met through dating apps that cater to gay men, meeting them at bars in the \"Gay Village\" area of Toronto, as well as male prostitutes. Also pictured, from left, lawyer Samantha Saunders, part of McArthur's defence team, McArthur, Justice Wendy Agnew and Crown Michael Cantlon. (Photo: Alexandra Newbould, AP)\n\nToronto police announced new charges Monday against a suspected serial killer who allegedly targeted gay men and immigrants for the 2015 killing of a Sri Lankan immigrant.\n\nThe suspect, self-employed landscaper Bruce McArthur, 66, now faces first-degree murder charges for the killing of Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam, who was slain sometime between Sept. 3 and Dec. 14, 2015, according to the Toronto Police Service.\n\nAll of the previously identified victims had ties to Toronto\u2019s Gay Village community. The killing spree dates back at least until 2010, according to police.\n\nPolice are still investigating Kanagaratnam\u2019s background, but have yet to find any connection between the immigrant and the historically gay neighborhood, said Detective Sgt. Hank Idsinga, the lead investigator.\n\nSeveral of the victims, including Kanagaratnam, were of Asian or Middle Eastern descent.\n\nInvestigators were able to identify Kanagaratnam, 37, who came to Canada from Sri Lanka in 2010, after releasing a photo of him last week. He had not been reported missing.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t quite fit the profile we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d said Idsinga, who declined to comment on Kanagaratnam\u2019s immigration status.\n\nMcArthur, who made a brief court appearance Monday where he was read the new charges, now has been implicated in the slayings of eight men between 2010 and 2017. Seven of the victims\u2019 remains were found in planters at a property where the suspect stored tools.\n\nPolice in Toronto have faced criticism in the city\u2019s LGBT community, who question why it took so long for authorities to ascertain a serial killer had been preying on gay men. The Toronto Globe & Mail and Toronto Star have reported that McArthur had been questioned by police in 2013 or 2014.\n\nToronto police launched a two-year investigation in 2012, looking into the disappearances of three men who were of similar age and physical appearance and who all had ties to the city's LGBT community. But that probe proved to be fruitless.\n\n\"We knew something was up. \u2026 We did not have the evidence,\" Chief Mark Saunders told The Globe and Mail in a February interview. \"If anyone knew before us, it's people who knew him very, very well. And so that did not come out.\"\n\nThe charges for Kanagaratnam\u2019s death come after authorities announced last week that McArthur had been charged with murder for the death of Abdulbasir \"Basir\" Faizi, who was reported missing in December 2010.\n\nPolice arrested McArthur in January and initially charged him with murdering Andrew Kinsman, an LGBT activist, and Selim Esen, 44, a Turkish immigrant. Both were last seen near the Gay Village last year.\n\nMcArthur was later charged with the murders of Dean Lisowick, a sex worker who struggled with drug addiction, Majeed Kayhan, a 58-year-old Afghan immigrant who had been missing since 2012; Soroush Marmoudi, a 50-year-old immigrant from Iran reported missing in 2015; Skandaraj Navaratnam, a refugee from Sri Lanka who was last seen in 2010.\n\nIdsinga said that investigators intend to search dozens of properties where McArthur worked as the weather warms in Canada. Investigators are also reviewing unsolved murder cases dating back to 1975, including several in which the victims are gay men, to see if their is a connection to McArthur.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2qCBA2X",

        "article.text": "LONDON/NEW YORK/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The United States has banned American firms from selling parts and software to China\u2019s ZTE Corp for seven years, potentially devastating for the telecoms equipment maker and exacerbating tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nThe move, first reported by Reuters, comes at a time when the two countries have threatened each other with tens of billions of dollars in tariffs in recent weeks, fanning worries of a full blown trade war that threatens global supply chains as well as business investment plans.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department imposed the ban following ZTE\u2019s violation of an agreement on punishing employees that was reached after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran.\n\nChina responded swiftly, warning it is prepared to take action to protect the interests of Chinese firms and saying it hopes the United States can deal with the issue in accordance with the law.\n\nThe U.S. action could be catastrophic for ZTE since American companies are estimated to provide 25 percent to 30 percent of the components used in ZTE\u2019s equipment, which includes smartphones and gear to build telecommunications networks.\n\n\u201cIf the issue cannot be solved smoothly and immediately, we think that ZTE will face tremendous disaster and would be forced to scale back on its smartphone business, not only in the U.S., but also in other markets,\u201d said Strategy Analytics analyst Woody Oh.\n\nZTE, whose Hong Kong and Shenzhen shares were suspended from trade on Tuesday, said in a statement it was assessing the implications of the U.S. decision and was communicating with \u201crelevant parties\u201d.\n\nThe company has set up a crisis management group in response to the ban, said a ZTE source, declining to be identified as the information was confidential.\n\nParticularly damaging, Google\u2019s mobile services including the Google Play App Store are likely to be covered by the ban even though the Android operating system is free, said Richard Windsor, an independent analyst at Radio Free Mobile.\n\n\u201cI think that there is a risk that ZTE loses all of its non-Chinese Android business,\u201d he said. \u201cIn almost every region outside of China, it is almost impossible to sell an Android handset that does not have Google Play installed.\u201d\n\nGoogle declined to comment.\n\nZTE is China\u2019s No. 2 telecom equipment maker after Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], the No. 4 seller of smartphones in the United States, and was worth some $20 billion as of Monday\u2019s close. In 2017, it derived 59 percent of revenue from its network business and 32 percent from its consumer business.\n\n\u201cIf the company is not able to resolve it, they may very well be put out of business by this. Many banks and companies even outside the U.S. are not going to want to deal with them,\u201d said Eric Hirschhorn, a former U.S. undersecretary of commerce who was heavily involved in the case.\n\nThe Chinese company paid $890 million in fines and penalties after it pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions by illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Shenzhen-based ZTE promised to dismiss four senior employees and discipline 35 others by either reducing their bonuses or reprimanding them, senior U.S. officials told Reuters.\n\nBut the Chinese company admitted in March that while it had fired the four senior employees, it had not disciplined or reduced bonuses to the 35 others.\n\nFLASHPOINT SECTOR\n\nSaying ZTE was likely to miss shipments and lose orders, brokerage Jefferies downgraded its rating on the firm to \u2018underperform\u2019 from \u2018buy\u2019 and slashed its price target to HK$15.72, nearly 40 percent below the firm\u2019s closing price prior to Tuesday\u2019s trading halt.\n\nVisitors are seen at a booth of Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp at an expo in Beijing, China, September 27, 2017. Picture taken September 27, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nBut Jefferies also said it expected ZTE would be able to settle with U.S. authorities in three to five months.\n\nUnder terms of the ban, U.S. companies cannot export prohibited goods, such as chip sets, directly to ZTE or via another country, beginning immediately.\n\nAs U.S. concerns about safeguarding its chip technology and cutting its trade deficit grow, the tech sector has become a flashpoint in the broader battle about trade and economic policy, with U.S. President Donald Trump accusing Chinese firms of intellectual property theft for years.\n\nWashington has also deepened its scrutiny of Chinese investment in the U.S., with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), blocking many proposed acquisitions of U.S. assets by Chinese companies.\n\nPiling further pressure on ZTE, Britain\u2019s main cyber security agency said on Monday it has written to organizations in the UK\u2019s telecommunications sector warning about using services or equipment from ZTE.\n\nThe ban on supplying ZTE comes two months after two Republican senators introduced legislation to block the U.S. government from buying or leasing telecommunications equipment from ZTE or Huawei, citing concern the companies would use their access to spy on U.S. officials.\n\n\u201cChina does not play by our rules, and we must be vigilant against Chinese threats to both our economic security and national security,\u201d said Republican Representative Robert Pittenger after the Commerce announcement. Pittenger is sponsoring legislation that would strengthen the U.S. national security review process for foreign investments.\n\nU.S. firms are also likely to get caught in the crossfire, with the fallout set to hit Qualcomm Inc, which provides the lion\u2019s share of chips inside ZTE smartphones. Qualcomm was not immediately available to comment.\n\nShares in optical networking equipment maker Acacia Communications Inc, which gained just under a third of its total 2017 revenue from ZTE, tumbled 35 percent. Acacia said it was suspending affected transactions and assessing the impact.\n\nOther optical component companies also slid, with Lumentum Holdings Inc falling 8.9 percent and Finisar Corp dropping 4 percent. Oclaro Inc, which got 18 percent of its fiscal 2017 revenue from ZTE, lost 14 percent.\n\nVisitors pass in front of the Chinese telecoms equipment group ZTE Corp booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2018.

The duo later escaped.\n\nNorth Korea has always denied abducting the couple, saying they had sought sanctuary there.\n\nMs Choi died on Monday afternoon in hospital in South Korea.\n\n\"My mother passed when she went to hospital for kidney dialysis this afternoon,\" Ms Choi's eldest son, director Shin Jeong-gyun, told news outlet Yonhap.\n\nThe kidnapping and a film buff\n\nBorn in November 1926 in South Korea's Gyeonggi province, Ms Choi began her film career in 1947.\n\nShe and her then-husband Shin Sang-ok eventually rose to be among South Korea's most celebrated film directors and stars.\n\nImage copyright BBC / Hellflower films / Shin Films Foundation Image caption This still of Ms Choi and Mr Shin is taken from a film about the couple, titled \"The Lovers and the Despot\"\n\nBut by the late 1970s, the couple had divorced and Choi's career had hit a downturn.\n\nIt was during that time that Choi was approached by someone posing as a Hong Kong businessman with a proposal to form a film-making company which would revive her fortunes.\n\nAccording to a book \"A Kim Jong-il Production\", she was persuaded to go to Hong Kong. Once in Hong Kong, she was grabbed and sedated by a group of men.\n\nEight days later she was in Pyongyang in a luxurious villa that was constantly guarded.\n\nDespite being divorced, Mr Shin and his ex-wife had remained close and he went to Hong Kong to look for her. He too was later abducted.\n\nImage copyright BBC / Hellflower films / Shin Films Foundation Image caption Mr Shin and Ms Choi are shown here with then North Korean leader Kim Jong-il (centre)\n\nThe late Mr Kim was said to be a great film buff, and an avid watcher of Hollywood movies. He had hoped that the couple's presence in the North could help their film industry compete on the international stage.\n\nAfter eight years, the couple won Mr Kim's trust and were allowed to travel to Vienna to promote their films.\n\nWhile in Vienna, the duo sought political asylum at the US embassy. They returned to South Korea years later and Mr Shin died in 2006.\n\nThe outlandish tale has gone on to grip audiences across the globe. In 2016, a film titled \"The Lovers and the Despot\" premiered, following the life of the couple as they were kidnapped and taken to North Korea.\n\n'Gone but never forgotten'\n\nMs Choi's passing has been widely mourned across South Korea.\n\n\"I went to see her movie when I was in high school,\" said 82-year-old actress Um Aing-ran. \"After seeing her acting I decided to become an actress.\"\n\nOther social media users also remembered her.\n\n\"You were such a beauty. You really had a rough life, you are gone now but your passion for acting will never be forgotten,\" said one user on Naver. \"I hope you reunited with Mr Shin and be happy.\"\n\n\"We say there is no life without a story. But her life was so dramatic,\" said another Naver user. \"I [will] remember your elegance. Rest in peace.\"\n\nMs Choi's funeral will be held on Thursday in Seoul.",

        "article.text": "Move prompted by numerous complaints from both residents and visitors, says mayor\u2019s office\n\nThe Hague has become the first Dutch city to ban the smoking of cannabis around its city centre, central railway station and major shopping areas, in the latest example of a wider trend towards reining in country\u2019s traditional gedoogbeleid (tolerance policy).\n\nFlyers are to be distributed at cannabis-selling coffee shops and homeless shelters to warn of fines for those caught breaching the ban. An English-language version of the flyer is to be made available in hotels.\n\nCannabis is sold openly in 573 coffee shops operating in 103 of the 380 municipalities in the Netherlands, including The Hague.\n\nHowever, awareness of the increase in strength of the varieties of the drug now available, compared with the 1970s when the tolerance policy was introduced, and concern that it is encouraging antisocial behaviour, has seeped into the thinking of central and municipal authorities in recent years.\n\nA spokesman for Pauline Krikke, the mayor of The Hague, said the \u201cmany complaints\u201d from residents and visitors about the strong smell of cannabis, and the noise from its users, had prompted the prohibition.\n\nThe spokesman added that the mayor and police had decided there was evidence that \u201cthe use of soft drugs has a negative impact on the living environment of residents and visitors\u201d in the areas where the ban will be in place.\n\nThe prohibition will be enforced by the police, with warnings given to those found to be using the drug in 13 designated public places over the next two weeks.\n\nFines, the level of which will be decided by the public prosector, will apply after that period, and the police will be proactively monitoring the doorways of shops for users.\n\nThe municipality of Amsterdam prohibits drug use around schools and playgrounds. Rotterdam introduced a ban on use in 2010 around five secondary vocational schools, which was later extended to schools across the entire city. The city has been also been seeking to reducing the number of coffee shops.\n\nThe development in The Hague is just the latest move in an attempt to tighten the rules around the sale and use of cannabis.\n\nRecent governments have clamped down by banning coffee shops in border areas from serving tourists.\n\nLast month the Dutch government announced a pilot scheme in 10 municipalities for the regulated production of cannabis, with cultivators recruited through a tender.\n\nCoffee shops can currently sell the drug butare not allowed to produce it, which critics say provides a clear opening for criminal gangs to become the suppliers.",

        "article.text": "North Korea officially recognized its leader Kim Jong Un's wife with the title of first lady. The state-controlled media used the honorific title in relation to Ri Sol Ju on Sunday as she made a first public appearance without her spouse.\n\nRi, who used to be identified by the title \"comrade,\" attended a performance of the classical ballet Giselle by the National Ballet of China, who were invited to perform in North Korea following Kim and Ri's visit to Beijing in March.\n\nThe Saturday performance took place at the Mansudae Art Theater in Pyongyang as part of the country's April Spring Friendship Art Festival honoring the birth of North Korea's founder, Kim's grandfather Kim Il Sung. North Korea's state-controlled media have only ever used the \"first lady\" title in relation to Kim Il Sung's wife Kim Song Ae, according to South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo.\n\nKCNA/via Reuters\n\nRi met with the accompanying delegation of Chinese officials, which included Song Tao, head of the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China, Li Qun, China's vice-minister of Culture and Tourism of China, and Li Jinjun, China's ambassador to North Korea.\n\nSitting on Tao's other side to enjoy the performance, was another powerful regime figure, Kim's younger sister Kim Yo Jong, who proved her diplomatic skills during a visit to South Korea in February.\n\nKCNA/via Reuters\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nThe North Korean leader also met the Chinese delegation, hosting a banquet in their honor in a room adorned with a wall-to-wall painting of Chinese President Xi Jinping shaking hands with Kim.

The couple received a red carpet treatment in China last month on their first foreign trip since Kim took power in December 2011 and Ri was also sitting at the table during the visit of South Korean presidential aide Chung Eui-yong in March, who traveled to the White House shortly afterward to propose a summit between Kim and President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to unidentified sources present at the March 5 dinner between Chung and the North Korean ruling couple, quoted in Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun, Ri welcomed Chung's suggestion that Kim should quit smoking, saying that she has often said he should, but Kim \"doesn't listen.\"\n\nSouth Korean media have also speculated that Ri could accompany Kim to the Joint Security Area in the Demilitarized Zone at the summit with South Korean president Moon Jae-in scheduled for April 27.\n\n\u201cRi is expected to have tea time with (South Korean) first lady Kim Jung-sook and attend a luncheon or state dinner hosted by President Moon Jae-in, alongside Kim Jong-un (on the visit)\u201d Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, told The Korea Herald earlier this month.",

But ensuring these steps are taken will make it significantly harder for hackers to succeed. 1) Enable two-factor authentication When it's set up, the system asks for a login and password just like usual \u2013 but then sends a unique numeric code to another device, using text message, email or a specialized app. Without access to that other device, the login is refused. 2) Encrypt your internet traffic A virtual private network (VPN) service encrypts digital communications, making it hard for hackers to intercept them. 3) Tighten up your password security Subscribe to a reputable password manager that suggests strong passwords and stores them in an encrypted file on your own computer. 4) Monitor your devices' behind-the-scenes activities Many computer programs and mobile apps keep running and sending data even when they are not actively in use. 5) Never open hyperlinks or attachments in any emails that are suspicious Even when they appear to come from a friend, use extreme caution \u2013 their email address might have been compromised. - Arun Vishwanath, Associate Professor of Communication, University at Buffalo, State University of New York\n\nMoscow has denied previous accusations that it carried out cyber attacks on the United States and other countries.\n\nUS intelligence agencies last year accused Russia of interfering in the 2016 election with a hacking and propaganda campaign supporting Donald Trump's campaign for president.\n\nLast month the Trump administration blamed Russia for a campaign of cyber attacks that targeted the US power grid.\n\nAmerican and British officials said that the attacks disclosed on Monday affected a wide range of organizations including internet service providers, private businesses and critical infrastructure providers.\n\nThey did not identify victims or provide details on the impact of the attacks.\n\n'When we see malicious cyber activity, whether it be from the Kremlin or other malicious nation-state actors, we are going to push back,' said Rob Joyce, the White House cyber security coordinator.\n\nRelations between Russia and Britain were already on edge after Prime Minister Theresa May blamed Moscow for the March 4 nerve agent poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the city of Salisbury.\n\n'This is yet another example of Russia's disregard for international norms and global order - this time through a campaign of cyber espionage and aggression, which attempts to disrupt governments and destabilise business,' a British government spokesman said in London.\n\nBritain and the United States said they issued the new alert to help targets protect themselves and persuade victims to share information with government investigators so they can better understand the threat.\n\n'We don't have full insight into the scope of the compromise,' said US Department of Homeland Security cyber security official Jeanette Manfra.\n\nThe alert is not related to the suspected chemical weapons attack in a town in Syria that prompted a US-led military strike over the weekend targeting facilities of the Russian-backed Syrian government, Joyce said.\n\nShortly after the announcement, the White House said Joyce would leave his post and return to the US National Security Agency.",

        "article.text": "In an open meeting this afternoon, a University of Manchester Vice-President, Professor Clive Agnew, told stunned students that the University is obligated to provide them \u201cwith a degree,\u201d rather than a complete education.\n\nStudents were fielding questions to a panel comprised of UoM Vice-Chancellor Dame Nancy Rothwell, alongside Deputy President and Deputy Vice-Chancellor Professor Luke Georghiou, and Vice-President for Teaching, Learning and Students, Professor Clive Agnew.\n\n(pictured from right to left above)\n\nWhen asked by a student about the University\u2019s perceived failure to deliver a satisfactory education, Professor Agnew stated: \u201cWe have taken advice on this and the contract is to deliver a degree, that is the focus.\u201d\n\nA further shout of \u201cNot an education?\u201d was ignored, as the panel hurridly attempted to shift focus.\n\nProfessor Agnew\u2019s response is unlikely to quell the complaints of students who feel that the learning experience and associated personal development that their courses once promised is forever lost.\n\nUoM students affected by the strike action should join the Take Action! UoM Facebook group, where a video of Professor Agnew\u2019s statement has been posted.\n\nVice-Chancellor Nancy Rothwell stated seemingly dozens of times during today\u2019s meeting that it would be virtually impossible to calculate compensation.\n\nWhen challenged that the Independent Adjudicator have indicated how they would calculate compensation due to students, the Vice-Chancellor claimed this was only applicable in cases where the student has been forced to withdraw from the course.\n\nThis is in contradiction to the UCU strike briefing note issued by the Independent Adjudicator back in March. The Adjudicator has tonight been contacted seeking clarification.\n\nWith a mere 30 minutes allocated for the meeting, and countless aggrieved students packing out the large boardroom to standing room only, many students did not get the chance to have their say. Both the final permitted question, and those asked from the crowd after the meeting was closed, were left unanswered.\n\nVice-Chancellor Rothwell was also challenged on the University\u2019s investment in companies such as Caterpillar that supply weaponry to the Israeli army, reportedly used in breaches of international law. Professor Rothwell again refused to answer as the question on the basis that it was asked after the meeting had closed.\n\nA history of The University of Manchester misleading students\n\nResponding to student complaints and demands for compensation emailed to Vice-Chancellor Nancy Rothwell in March, UoM Director of Communications Michael Greenhalgh told students en-masse that it would be \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to calculate compensation, be that on an individual or group basis.\n\nHowever, the Independent Adjudicator awards compensation from universities (including UoM!) to thousands of students each year, and confirm in their briefing note that many of these relate to teaching that has not been delivered.\n\nThis leaves two possible conclusions.\n\n1 \u2013 UoM\u2019s management, when drafting their response to demands for compensation and claiming it was \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to calculate, were so incompetent they did not know that compensation is calculated on a regular basis.\n\n2 \u2013 UoM\u2019s management feigned ignorance of this process with the scandalous intent of hushing student complaints.\n\nFinal year and Masters students hardest hit\n\nMany Masters students claim their degree has been \u201cruined\u201d by the effects of strike action. With most Masters students only studying for one year, this would have consisted of just two 10 week semesters, followed by a dissertation.\n\nWhilst seminars have taken place as normal either side of the strike action, the substantial amount of missed teaching has decimated the cumulative learning experience of the semester. Many students have also missed out on a potentially vital \u2018Dissertation Research Design\u2019 module, leaving them ill-equipped to complete their dissertations over the summer.",

Taken orally, the drug targets what are known as RET-driven cancers, including types of thyroid and lung cancers, which are normally hard to treat.\n\nRET is a type of receptor tyrosine kinase, and mutations that kick its activity into overdrive are linked to certain kinds of cancer. Among others, RET plays a role in around 50 percent of medullary thyroid cancers, 20 percent of papillary thyroid cancers, and up to two percent of non-small cell lung cancers. These can be treated with conventional methods, although so far success hasn't been stellar.\n\n\"There is a critical un-met need for effective drugs against cancers that have the RET alteration, as there are no highly potent inhibitors currently approved specifically for these RET-driven cancers,\" says Vivek Subbiah, lead researcher on the study. \"The current treatments for these cancers are limited to traditional chemotherapy and earlier generations of multiple kinase inhibitors. These options have had limited success with often considerable side effects that significantly impact the patient's quality of life.\"\n\nBLU-667 works by inhibiting the activity of RET, and it was chosen for further study after it was found to be 100 times more selective for RET, meaning it shouldn't affect the functions of other kinases. It's also been shown to prevent certain genetic mutations that may allow the body to resist this kind of treatment.\n\nFor this trial, the team studied 43 patients with advanced tumors that weren't able to be operated on, as well as 26 patients with medullary thyroid cancer, 15 with non-small cell lung cancer, and two with other RET-related cancers.

        "article.text": "Reuters/Lucas Jackson\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos may be the world's richest person, with a net worth of about $112 billion (\u00a378 billion), but at least some of those working on his warehouse floors are apparently so desperate to keep their jobs that they don't even take time to use a restroom.\n\nThe author James Bloodworth went undercover at an Amazon warehouse in Staffordshire, UK, for a book on low wages in Britain. He found that the warehouse's fulfillment workers, who run around Amazon's massive warehouses gathering products for delivery, had a \"toilet bottle\" system in place because the bathrooms were too sparse to get to quickly.\n\n\"For those of us who worked on the top floor, the closest toilets were down four flights of stairs,\" Bloodworth told The Sun. \"People just peed in bottles because they lived in fear of being \u00addisciplined over 'idle time' and \u00adlosing their jobs just because they needed the loo.\"\n\nAmazon is known to track how fast its warehouse workers can pick and package items from its shelves, imposing strictly timed breaks and targets. It issues warning points for those who don't meet its goals or who take extended breaks.\n\nA separate survey found almost three-quarters of UK fulfillment-center staff members were afraid of using the toilet because of time concerns. A report released Monday with the survey's findings said 241 Amazon warehouse employees in England were interviewed.\n\nThe survey anonymously quoted one person as saying targets had \"increased dramatically\" and \"I do not drink water because I do not have time to go to the toilet.\"\n\nAnother said: \"The target grows every year. I do not have two more legs yet to make the 100% to pick, where you actually need to run and go to the toilet just during the break. Packing 120 products per hour is terribly heavy.\n\n\"You have to pack two products per minute. You do not have time to drink water because you go to the toilet after every evening sends messages to the scanner with the target and tells you to hurry.\"\n\nThe survey, compiled by the worker campaign platform Organise, also found that respondents said they felt considerably more anxious after joining Amazon.\n\nWorkers say they have been punished for being sick\n\nAnother employee said she was ill while pregnant and was still given a warning.\n\nAnd yet another said: \"I turned up for my shift even though I felt like s---, managed 2 hours then I just could not do anymore. Told my supervisor and was signed off sick, I had a gastric bug (sickness and diarrhoea, very bad) saw my doc. Got a sick note with an explanation, but still got a strike.\"\n\nAmazon disputed the allegations. The company said in a statement to Business Insider:\n\n\"Amazon provides a safe and positive workplace for thousands of people across the UK with competitive pay and benefits from day one. We have not been provided with confirmation that the people who completed the survey worked at Amazon and we don't recognize these allegations as an accurate portrayal of activities in our buildings.\n\n\"We have a focus on ensuring we provide a great environment for all our employees and last month Amazon was named by LinkedIn as the 7th most sought after place to work in the UK and ranked first place in the US. Amazon also offers public tours of its fulfillment centres so customers can see first-hand what happens after they click 'buy' on Amazon.\"\n\nAmazon said it didn't time workers' toilet breaks and set its performance targets based on previous worker performance. The company said it provided coaching to help people improve and used \"proper discretion\" when it came to sick leave and absences from work.\n\nThe company also said it provided on-site occupational health and physiotherapy support as well as legal, financial, and workplace guidance.\n\nIf you worked in an Amazon warehouse and would like to share your horror stories, email in confidence to sghosh@businessinsider.com.",

This is taking longer than expected but has moved a big step closer with the latest results.\n\nThe interim results of the phase II/III trial of 301 people will be presented in Paris on Thursday. It has been funded by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, one of DNDi\u2019s founding partners which also include France\u2019s Institut Pasteur.\n\nDNDi said 97% of patients were cured after being treated with the combination pill for 12 weeks. Even hard-to-treat cases such as people with HIV or liver cirrhosis showed very high cure rates, of 96% and 97% respectively.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Egyptian labourers queue for hepatitis C test. Egypt has the highest prevalence of hepatitis C infections in the world \u2013 7% of Egyptians between the ages of 15 and 59 are infected with the virus. The epidemic started after government mass vaccinations were carried out with unsterilised syringes in the 1950s. Photograph: Khaled Desouki/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHepatitis C is a blood-borne viral infection that can lead to liver cirrhosis, cancer and death. It affects more than 71 million people worldwide and causes 400,000 deaths a year. Although highly effective medicines have been available for several years, their high cost means that less than three million people are on treatment.\n\nNHS 'abandoning' thousands by rationing hepatitis C drugs Read more\n\nUS drugmaker Gilead has lowered the price of its Harvoni tablet and other medicines in lower and middle-income countries, but it is still too high for governments to roll out mass hepatitis C treatment programmes.\n\nHarvoni now costs about $48,000 for a 12-week course in Malaysia and $12,000 in Chile. Gilead\u2019s previous Sovaldi treatment cost $1,000 a pill, or $84,000 over 12 weeks. Prices vary around the world and tend to be highest in the US.\n\nGilead has come under pressure from US rival AbbVie, which launched a new hepatitis C medicine, Mavyret, last year with a shorter, eight-week treatment course priced at $26,400.\n\nBernard P\u00e9coul, executive director of DNDi, said: \u201cThe results indicate that the sofosbuvir/ravidasvir combination is comparable to the very best hepatitis C therapies available today but it is priced affordably and could allow an alternative option in countries excluded from pharmaceutical company access programmes.\u201d\n\nBritain's contaminated blood scandal: \u2018I need them to admit they killed our son\u2019 Read more\n\nThe treatment is expected to be available in Malaysia within one to two years. DNDi has also signed deals in Latin America to make it available for $500 for the 12 week course, with a provision to bring the price down to $300.\n\nThe trial using medicines produced by Pharco was run by DNDi and co-sponsored by the Malaysian Ministry of Health.\n\nThe medicine has also been tested on 300 patients in Egypt, who have different genetic characteristics, with a 100% cure rate. Further studies are being carried out in South Africa and Ukraine to cover all six genotypes of the disease.\n\nDNDi has licensed rights for ravidasvir in low and middle income countries from the Californian firm that developed it, Presidio Pharmaceuticals. The UK has an estimated 215,000 hepatitis C cases, while the US has 3.4m.",

        "article.text": "Updated |Scientists in California successfully changed a protein associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease into a more harmless form, allowing them to erase brain cell damage. The breakthrough is especially important because the research was not conducted on mice but rather human cells.\n\nResearchers from the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco took stem cells from Alzheimer\u2019s patients who had two copies of the apoE4 gene as well as stem cells from healthy volunteers who also had a pair of the apoE3 gene, a study published online Tuesday said. They then created neurons, or brain cells, from these stem cells.\n\nThrough studying these neurons, the team was able to identify exactly why apoE4 puts individuals at such increased risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. For example, having one apoE4 gene more than doubles the chances of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and possessing two copies of the gene increases risk of developing the neurodegenerative brain disease by 12-fold, a statement on the study reported.\n\nNow we know this is because the apoE4 gene, which creates the apoE4 protein, increases the production of the amyloid beta protein. This finding surprised the researchers, as the presence of the apoE4 gene in mouse models did not increase amyloid beta production.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important from this study is that we used human cells,\u201d Yadong Huang, senior investigator at Gladstone and lead author of the study told Newsweek. \u201cThe many previous studies were performed on animal models or animal cells.\u201d\n\nIncreased amyloid beta production is significant because in some cases, these proteins can clump together and form plaques. These plaques can disrupt neuron messaging and in turn cause many of the symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease, such as cognitive problems.\n\nPascal Lachenaud/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSee all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows\n\nOnce the team confirmed that the presence of apoE4 promoted Alzheimer\u2019s disease, they then worked on a way to prevent this. They developed a way to change the structure of the apoE4 protein in order to make it harmless. This erased any damage of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and helped increase brain cell survival in the human cell model.\n\nThe results are promising, especially since they were seen in human cells and not an animal model. Still, the research is not quite a cure, at least not yet. The results will have to be repeated in human patients. The researchers are now working to translate this finding into a compound that can be used on an industrial level so that eventual human trials will be possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict how long it would take but we are working very hard right now to narrow it down from many small molecule candidates to finally focus on one or two and then hopefully move to the clinical trials,\u201d said Huang.\n\nCorrection: This article has been corrected to state that the healthy volunteers had a pair of the apoE3 gene.\n\nUpdate: This article has been updated with additional quotes from Yadong Huang.",

        "article.text": "Weeks before the world saw the bodies of men, women, and children dead from an apparent Syrian military chemical attack in Douma, Syria, the Russian military was already spreading bizarre conspiracy theories about an impending \u201cfalse flag\u201d chemical attack carried out by rebels.\n\nRussian conspiracy propaganda and truther chum have been a staple of official discourse whenever Moscow wants to cover up bad behavior by its allies in Damascus. When the Assad regime used sarin nerve agents on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in 2017, Russian officials accused Syrian first responders\u2014a group known as the White Helmets\u2014of fabricating the attacks\u2014saying it was impossible to explain otherwise how the group \u201cmanaged to work for such a long period of time and remain alive without gas masks and special protection equipment\u201d while documenting the attack.\n\nRussia\u2019s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia has dredged up the same talking points now to label Douma a \u201cpretext\u201d that was \u201ceagerly provided by the White Helmets\u2019 provocateurs.\u201d But this time, the propaganda campaign got a head start\u2014and they\u2019ve even tried to remix old children\u2019s plays and spy novels to make their point.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s perhaps interesting in this one is the way that Russian officialdom started building the narrative on a false flag a month ago,\u201d Ben Nimmo, a researcher at Atlantic Council\u2019s Digital Forensic Research Lab who studies disinformation campaigns, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThere\u2019s a measure of foresight and forethought there which is quite interesting.\u201d\n\nBeginning in early March, Russia\u2019s ministry of defense began to claim that it had picked up intelligence about \u201cprovocations\u201d planned by Islamist militant groups outside Damascus designed \u201cto accuse government troops of using chemical weapons in the Eastern Ghouta against civilians.\u201d Defense ministry officials later elaborated that the conspiracy to mount false-flag chemical attacks involved a whole cast of characters ranging from U.S. special operations forces operating in the Syrian desert to Free Syrian Army members in the south of the country to al Qaeda members in Idlib Province.\n\nThe anticipatory claims about rebel chemical weapons provocations coincided with mounting frustration in the Trump administration over the Assad regime\u2019s continued use of chlorine gas attacks in and around East Ghouta. Reports of Syrian military chemical attacks died down in the months after the Trump administration struck a Syrian air base in retaliation for the sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun, but began to increase as the Assad regime pressed an operation to take back the northeastern suburbs occupied by rebels.\n\nRussia\u2019s announcement of the false flag conspiracy followed a late February meeting by the Trump administration to consider a potential military response to Syria\u2019s ongoing chemical weapons use, according to The Washington Post.\n\nRussian diplomats have used the conspiracies floated in March to try and validate their claims of a false flag, but Moscow still can\u2019t seem to get its story straight about whether the conspiracy raised in March involved a fake chemical attack or a real one. The March claims all involved chemical weapons being used by rebels. Russia\u2019s UN ambassador has since argued that there \u201cwere no chemical substances found on the ground, no dead bodies found, no poisoned people in the hospitals.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the attack, pro-Russian, pro-Assad and general conspiracy enthusiast social media trolls have joined the fray to make Moscow\u2019s case\u2014with a little help from Russian state media. \u201c[Trump] said let\u2019s pull out of Syria, as a deflection, So that a week later he can declare war,\u201d cried the famously pro-Assad troll Partisangirl. \u201cHe knew a chemical false flag was planned.\u201d\n\nOutlets like Sputnik have amplified spy-novel stories about several British commandos captured near the scene of the attack in Douma supposedly operating on behalf of an international Super Friends alliance of the U.S., Israel, Jordan, and the U.K. aiming to thwart the recapture of rebel-held territory.\n\n\u201cTherefore, the US has ordered Jaysh al-Islam, Faylaq al-Rahman and other terrorist groups to allow the evacuation of civilians from Eastern Ghouta to army-held regions in a bid to provide the ground for these foreign agents to also leave Ghouta in disguise and enable the Turkish intelligence service to send them to specified regions in At-Tanf and northern Syria,\u201d according to the intricate claim.\n\nSocial-media trolls have also spun their own artisanal disinformation since the Douma incident, taking footage of a 2013 children\u2019s play about chemical weapons put on for kids in East Ghouta and editing the video to claim that civilians in rebel-held areas are teaching children to fake chemical weapons attacks. The play, put on by volunteers shortly after the 2013 sarin attack in East Ghouta, had local children lying on the ground acting out the part of poisoning victims as assembled kids watched and applauded. Twitter trolls grabbed the footage from YouTube, edited it down and circulated it blaring \u201cLET'S PLAY FAKE SYRIAN CHEMICAL ATTACK children's party!\u201d\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason.\n\nBy and large, though, social media propaganda in the wake of the alleged Douma chemical attack has closely resembled that seen after the Khan Sheikhoun nerve gas attack. \u201cThe main things we\u2019ve been seeing are attacks on the White helmets, calling them terrorists and calling it a false flag,\u201d Nimmo said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen this time around are attacks on the White Helmets, calling them terrorists and calling it a false flag.\u201d\n\nThe conspiracy theories about the White Helmets and Douma piggyback on a well-developed disinformation infrastructure aimed at discrediting the civil defense group.

Gillnetting has been banned in Antarctic waters since 2006 and is described by Australia as posing a \u201chuge risk to almost all marine life, including marine mammals due to [its] indiscriminate nature\u201d.\n\nThe use of the nets also harm seabirds including endangered albatrosses, the country\u2019s environment department said on its website in 2011.\n\nIndonesia was acting on a request from Interpol when it seized the officially stateless craft. It had eluded authorities by flying eight different flags at different times, including those of Sierra Leone, Togo, Cambodia, South Korea, Japan, Micronesia and Namibia, the ministry said in a statement.\n\nInterpol contacted Indonesia last week with a request to investigate the vessel, fisheries minister Susi Pudjiastuti said in the statement.\n\n\u201cNavy ship Simeuleu conducted a \u2018stop, investigate and detain\u2019 operation on Friday and successfully seized the vessel,\u201d she said.\n\nThe STS-50 had previously been detained by China, but escaped and was caught in the port of Maputo in Mozambique before fleeing again, Ms Pudjiastuti said.\n\nPrior to its capture off the Indonesian island of Weh in the northwestern province of Aceh, the vessel had also operated under several other names including Sea Breeze, Andrey Dolgov, STD No. 2 and Aida, the statement said.\n\nShipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows the 54m-long, 452-tonne vessel was built in 1985.\n\nAn Antarctic toothfish (NOAA NMFS SWFSC Antarctic Marine Living Resources ( AMLR ) Program)\n\nAt the time of its capture, the STS-50 had 20 Indonesian and Russian crew, the ministry said. It was not immediately clear what would happen to them.\n\nNavy deputy chief of staff Achmad Taufiqoerrochman was quoted in the statement as saying the Indonesian crew lacked travel documents and had been at sea for a long time without pay, indicating they may have been victims of trafficking.\n\nFishing for Antarctic toothfish is governed by the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which forbids gillnet fishing and imposes strict rules on catches in the Southern Ocean.\n\n\u201cWe want this to be an example for the world to not compromise with illegal fishing,\u201d Ms Pudjiastuti said.\n\nWorld news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51 show all World news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/51 16 April 2018 People participate in a protest against the rape of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua near Jammu, and a teenager in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh state, in Bangalore, India Reuters\n\n2/51 15 April 2018 Fireworks are set off as the final performance takes place during the Closing Ceremony for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

        "article.text": "Robert Mueller. AP\n\nThe special counsel Robert Mueller's team is moving forward on the assumption that it will not secure an interview with President Donald Trump, NBC News reported Thursday.\n\nTrump's lawyers and Mueller's team had for months been negotiating the terms of an interview between the two sides.\n\nOn Monday, NBC News reported, Trump's lawyers were in the final stages of determining the scope, timing, and length of an interview and were poised to bring attorneys onto the team to prepare Trump for the impending sit-down. But those talks fell through when it surfaced that the FBI that morning raided the hotel room and office of Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nThe raid apparently enraged Trump, who believes it crossed the \"red line\" he said investigators would breach if they looked into his or his family's finances.\n\nEarlier this month, The Washington Post reported that Mueller's team was putting together a report about Trump's conduct in office and possible obstruction of justice.\n\nMueller is tasked with investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 US election, and a significant thread in the inquiry is whether the president sought to obstruct justice when he fired James Comey as FBI director last year.\n\nComey had publicly confirmed the existence of the Russia investigation months before his firing, and he was in charge of overseeing it at the time of his dismissal.\n\nSince then, news reports and a string of public statements from Trump have raised questions about the circumstances surrounding Comey's firing and whether Trump had the right to fire the FBI director if his intent were to hamper a criminal investigation involving him and his associates.\n\nIn addition to Comey's firing, Mueller was also looking into Trump's role in crafting a misleading statement his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., released in response to reports that he met with two Russian lobbyists in June 2016, and into Trump's efforts to pressure Attorney General Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal from the Russia investigation.\n\nAnd in a new development, NBC News reported that Mueller was investigating whether Trump's former lawyer floated pardons to critical witnesses in the investigation.\n\nAccording to the report, Mueller has collected evidence on all those threads in the obstruction inquiry.\n\nMueller's team was aiming to finalize the report on its findings as early as May or as late as July. But if the special counsel has decided to proceed without an interview, the timeline may shorten.\n\nThe outlet described two sources familiar with the investigation as expecting \"a flurry of activity\" out of Mueller's office in the next six weeks.\n\nAlex Whiting, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at Harvard Law School, said the NBC News report wasn't surprising.\n\n\"I am sure that Mueller's team has enough evidence to draw conclusions on the obstruction prong without an interview with Trump,\" Whiting said. \"An interview of the potential target of the investigation is always helpful, but most criminal investigations conclude without such an interview, because targets assert their Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify.\"\n\nSubpoenaing Trump is a 'strategic choice' that Mueller most likely won't pursue\n\nREUTERS/Lucas Jackson\n\nMueller has the option of subpoenaing Trump for an interview, but legal experts unequivocally said that would lead to a prolonged battle in court.\n\nNBC News reported that if Trump were to decline a voluntary sit-down with the special counsel, his lawyers would argue that because a sitting president cannot be indicted, he also cannot be subpoenaed.\n\nWhiting said that whether Mueller subpoenas Trump to testify before a grand jury was \"really a strategic choice.\"\n\n\"He will have to decide whether it is worth the time to litigate the matter,\" he said. \"Even if they prevailed on the subpoena, Trump himself could always assert his Fifth Amendment privilege, though it would be politically costly to do so.\"\n\nFor that reason, Mueller is likely to move ahead with putting together his report without an interview.\n\nNews that Mueller is preparing a report about those circumstances lays out some important clues about the direction of the investigation.\n\nIt could indicate one of three things, according to Jeffrey Cramer, a former federal prosecutor who spent 12 years at the Department of Justice:\n\nThe president did nothing wrong and will not be charged. Mueller found some indication of criminal activity but might not have enough evidence to indict Trump. Mueller does have enough evidence to indict Trump but may decide he does not have the authority to charge the president based on Department of Justice precedent.\n\nLegal experts say that because of existing Justice Department policy, it is unlikely Mueller will indict Trump if he has found evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThey added that the decision about how to proceed once Mueller issues his report would fall to Congress, which is authorized to impeach the president \u2014 and where such a document could prove most consequential.\n\nMueller's office has so far charged 19 people, including 13 Russian nationals. The indictments \u2014 as well as the charges against Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman \u2014 draw a stark and detailed picture of the allegations of criminal conduct.\n\n\"Similar to the Manafort and Russian indictments, I expect any report [about Trump] to lay out in painstaking detail the facts they uncovered,\" Cramer said.\n\nMueller is mandated to provide reports of his findings to Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who appointed him as the special counsel in May. But whether those findings are released to the public is Rosenstein's decision.\n\nWhiting said he found it \"striking\" that \"Mueller seems to be preparing the report with an expectation that it will eventually become public.\"\n\nHe added: \"Once the investigation is completed, I think it will be very difficult to keep Mueller's conclusions secret.\"",

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 14, 2018 Report\n\nA Pentagon briefing on Saturday said the strikes had \"set the Syrian chemical weapons programme back for years\".\n\nLater there was a bitter exchange between the US and Russia at the United Nations.\n\nThe wave of strikes is the most significant attack against President Bashar al-Assad's government by Western powers in seven years of Syria's civil war.\n\nResponding to the strikes, Mr Assad said in comments published by his office: \"This aggression will only make Syria and its people more determined to keep fighting and crushing terrorism in every inch of the country.\"\n\nWhere was hit?\n\nAt a Pentagon briefing on Saturday, Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie listed the three targets that had been struck in a \"precise, overwhelming and effective\" manner:\n\nThe Barzah chemical weapons research and development centre near Damascus was hit by 76 missiles, 57 of them Tomahawk cruise missiles, and \"destroyed\"\n\nThe Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility near Homs was hit by 22 missiles - nine US Tomahawks, eight British Storm Shadows and five naval cruise missiles and two Scalp cruise missiles launched by France\n\nThe Him Shinshar chemical weapons bunker facility near Homs was targeted with seven Scalp missiles and was \"successfully hit\"\n\nGen McKenzie said the \"initial indications are that we accomplished the military objectives without interference from Syria\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gen Kenneth McKenzie: \"We deployed 105 weapons\"\n\nHe said \"none of the aircraft or missiles were successfully engaged\" by defence systems and all aircraft had returned.\n\nGen McKenzie said about 40 Syrian defence missiles were fired, mostly after the targets were hit. No Russian defence systems were operated, he said.\n\nThe Pentagon briefing conflicted with information given at a Russian defence ministry briefing, which said Russian units had tracked the actions of the US and UK forces, but not the French.\n\nThe ministry said 103 cruise missiles had been launched and 71 were shot down by Syrian systems.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"Rumbling like thunder\": A CBS reporter in Damascus witnessed the start of the strikes\n\nIt accepted the \"alleged chemical weapons facilities\" near Damascus and Homs were \"partially destroyed\".\n\nThe ministry said there were other locations that were targeted but not hit, including Damascus International Airport and the al-Dumayr and Blai airdromes, and the Shayrat air base.\n\nThe ministry said \"preliminary information\" suggested there had been no casualties among the Syrian army or civilians.\n\nThe Pentagon said it also had no confirmation of any civilian casualties.\n\nThe US had communicated with Russia ahead of the strikes through the normal procedures of their \"deconfliction\" hotline, which is used to prevent accidental clashes in a war zone.\n\nThere had been concerns that if the US strike had hit Russian military personnel on the ground, it would further escalate tension.\n\nThe US says the scale of the strikes was about \"double\" what was launched in April 2017 after a chemical attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed more than 80 people.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amateur footage shows strikes on a military research facility in Damascus, while state TV shows the damage\n\nWhat was said at the UN?\n\nAt an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council called by Russia, the Russian envoy to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, read out a quote from President Putin saying the action of the US and its allies had made a \"catastrophic situation in Syria even worse\".\n\nMr Putin accused the allies of \"cynical disdain\" in acting without waiting for the results of a chemical watchdog investigation into the Douma attack. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inspectors are expected to arrive in the area this weekend.\n\nUS envoy Nikki Haley said the strikes were \"justified, legitimate and proportionate\".\n\nShe said the US and its allies had given diplomacy \"chance after chance\" but Russia had continued to veto UN resolutions.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Donald Trump and Theresa May on the air strikes in Syria\n\nShe said: \"We cannot stand by and let Russia trash every international norm and allow use of chemical weapons to go unanswered.\"\n\nMs Haley said she had spoken to President Trump and he had said the US was \"locked and loaded\" if Syria used chemical weapons again.\n\nShe said: \"When our president draws a red line, our president enforces the red line.\"\n\nBashar Jaafari, Syria's envoy to the UN, repeated that the alleged Douma attack was a \"masquerade\" mounted by rebels.\n\nHe also said OPCW inspectors had previously visited the targeted Barzeh site and reported no chemical weapons activities there.\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he wanted to remind all members that \"there is an obligation to act consistently with the charter of the UN and international law in general\" and added that there was \"no military solution\" to the Syria crisis.\n\nThe UN Security Council rejected a Russian resolution condemning the strikes.\n\nWhat role did the UK and France play?\n\nAccording to the UK Ministry of Defence, four RAF Tornado jets hit a site near Homs with eight Storm Shadow cruise missiles.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May said there was \"no practicable alternative to the use of force\" but also added that the strikes were not about \"regime change\".\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron also confirmed his country's participation in the operation.\n\n\"Dozens of men, women and children were massacred with chemical weapons,\" he said of the Douma incident a week ago.\n\nOn Saturday, the Syrian army announced that the eastern Ghouta region, where Douma is situated, had been cleared of the last rebel fighters and was fully retaken.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What's it like to be in a chemical attack? Survivors recount Ghouta in 2013\n\nAnalysis: Will this time be different?\n\nJonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent\n\nThis attack was more significant than the US strike against a Syrian air base a little over a year ago, but at first sight seems more limited than President Trump's rhetoric may have suggested.\n\nLast year some 59 missiles were fired. This time a little over double that number were used.\n\nThe strikes are over for now, but there was a clear warning that if the Assad regime resorts to chemical weapons again, then further strikes may well follow.\n\nCare was taken, say the Americans, to avoid both Syrian and \"foreign\" - for that read Russian - casualties.\n\nBut the fundamental questions remain. Will President Assad be deterred?\n\nLast year's US strike failed to change his behaviour. This time, will it be any different?\n\nHow has the rest of the world responded?\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel - who had ruled out joining the military action - said she supported the strikes as \"necessary and appropriate\".\n\nNato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the Nato allies fully supported the actions of the US, UK and France.\n\nIsraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his \"total support\" for the air strikes.\n\nChina said it opposed the use of force and that there could only be a political solution to the Syrian conflict.",

Section 16 states that an individual who \u201ccommits an act of serious indecency\u201d \u2014 defined as an act \u201cother than sexual intercourse\u201d involving the \u201cuse of the genital organ for the purpose of arousing or gratifying sexual desire\u201d \u2014could face 5 years in prison.\n\nLGBTQ activist Jason Jones filed a lawsuit in February 2017 to overturn Trinidad and Tobago's gay sex laws. Sean Drakes / LatinContent - Getty Images file\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in February 2017 by LGBTQ activist Jason Jones against the country\u2019s attorney general. Jones, a native of Trinidad and Tobago and the United Kingdom, claimed Sections 13 and 16 of the Sexual Offenses Act violated his right to privacy and freedom of expression.\n\nFollowing Judge Rampersad\u2019s ruling, Jones took to Twitter to celebrate his victory and thank his supporters.\n\nKenita Placide, a Caribbean adviser for LGBTQ human rights group OutRight Action International, which has been following the case, applauded Judge Rampersad\u2019s decision in a statement sent to NBC News.\n\n\u201cThe judge came down on the right side of history in this case by striking down the buggery law and ruling it as unconstitutional,\u201d Placide stated. \u201cThe activism and advocacy will continue in Trinidad and Tobago and across the Caribbean until equality for LGBTIQ people is guaranteed.\u201d\n\nPlacide said she hopes the ruling in Trinidad and Tobago, along with a similar 2016 ruling in Belize, will carry the momentum to other parts of the region with anti-LGBTQ rules on the books.\n\nNot everyone in the country of 1.3 million was rooting for the removal of laws banning gay sex. According to OutRight Action International, opposition from conservative religious groups was strong.\n\nA spokesperson for Christian group T&T Cause warned that the removal of the \u201cbuggery laws\u201d would be a \u201cslippery slope to same-sex marriage,\u201d which she called \u201ca cancer.\u201d\n\nThe decision by Judge Rampersad sets in motion the decriminalization of homosexuality in Trinidad and Tobago, but a final judgment regarding exactly what will happen to Sections 13 and 16 of the Sexual Offenses Act will be made in July.\n\nMore than 70 nations around the world currently criminalize homosexuality, and in several countries the punishment for same-sex sexual activity could be death, according to a 2017 report by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Association (ILGA).\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM",

However, ministers decided that such a law would curb their freedom to act, make them susceptible to potential legal action, and result in their becoming entangled in arguments about the definition of training and combat missions.\n\nIn the US, the War Powers Act is a federal law intended to check the president's power to commit the country to an armed conflict without the consent of Congress. The War Powers Resolution requires the president to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action.\n\nMr Corbyn has accused Ms May of \u201ctrailing after Donald Trump\u201d. Condemning the attacks, he claimed they would make real accountability for war crimes less likely.\n\n\u201cBombs won\u2019t save lives or bring about peace,\" he said. \"This legally questionable action risks escalating further, as US defence secretary James Mattis has admitted, an already devastating conflict and therefore makes real accountability for war crimes and use of chemical weapons less, not more likely.\u201d\n\nMs May sidestepped a non-binding constitutional convention that dates back to the 2003 invasion of Iraq by launching strikes without prior approval from parliament.\n\nHowever, the PM insisted speed was essential and the action against Syria was in the UK's national interest.\n\nMs May said the attacks were \u201cright and legal\u201d and \u201cgave a very clear message to the regime\u201d.\n\nAllied air strikes were carried out in Syria in response to a suspected poison gas attack that led to the deaths of 40 people in the town of Douma near Damascus last Saturday.\n\nThe intervention is the largest so far by Western powers in the Syrian conflict, with more than 100 missiles launched at various targets. Labour has been opposed to a military strike on Syria since the chemical weapons attack on Douma.\n\nRussia, an ally of the Syrian government led by Bashar al-Assad, has warned the strikes will have \u201cconsequences\u201d. Russian president Vladimir Putin claimed the attack would aggravate the humanitarian crisis in the country.",

        "article.text": "The push towards decriminalization comes as the opioid crisis continues to claim thousands of lives on both sides of the 49th parallel\n\nWith months left before Canada becomes the first country in the G7 to fully legalise marijuana, members of the country\u2019s Liberal party, led federally by Justin Trudeau, are calling on their government to go one step further and decriminalise the possession and consumption of all illicit drugs.\n\nThe internal push to embrace the idea is one of more than two dozen resolutions set to be debated this week as the political party gathers for their national convention in the east coast city of Halifax. The resolution is one of three put forward by the national caucus, suggesting widespread support among Liberal MPs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the few issues where we\u2019re taught from a young age, that drugs are bad and that it\u2019s normal to throw people in jail for using drugs,\u201d said Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, a Liberal MP who has championed decriminalisation since he was elected in 2015.\n\n\u201cYet when you actually start looking underneath those claims and at the actual evidence and hear from people who have study or lived this issue, this isn\u2019t the right approach.\u201d\n\nCanadian province gambles future on marijuana's 'extreme growth potential' Read more\n\nFraming drug use as a criminal justice issue rather than one of health has simply served to fuel a lucrative black market, divert resources from law enforcement and marginalise those who are often already on the margins of society, he argued.\n\nThe push towards decriminalisation comes as the opioid crisis continues to claim thousands of lives on both sides of the 49th parallel. An estimated 4,000 Canadians died last year due to opioids, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada \u2013 more than the number of Canadians who died due to motor vehicle accidents and homicides combined.\n\nIn British Columbia, the western Canadian province where officials declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency in 2016, an average of four people die of overdoses each day.\n\nThe federal Liberal government has taken steps to address the crisis, expediting the approval of supervised injection sites and permitting physicians to prescribe heroin in cases of severe addiction. These are important steps, said Erskine-Smith. \u201cBut obviously if we want to save lives we need to do more.\u201d\n\nThat could mean adopting an idea that is gaining steam across Canada as the number of opioid deaths continue to swell. Earlier this year, Canada\u2019s New Democratic Party became the first major political party in Canada to officially champion the idea.\n\nWeeks later the city of Vancouver recommended that the federal government immediately decriminalise personal possession of illicit drugs. \u201cWe are witnessing a horrific and preventable loss of life as a poisoned drug supply continues to kill our neighbours, friends and family,\u201d Gregor Robertson, Vancouver\u2019s mayor, said in a statement.\n\nTheir stance is backed by prominent organisations, from the Global Commission on Drug Policy to the World Health Organization. Many of them point to the experience of Portugal, which in 2001 did away with criminal penalties for simple possession and consumption of illicit drugs.\n\nThe move was coupled with an expansion of treatment and harm reduction services such as safe injection sites. In Portugal, those caught with drugs appear before dissuasion commissions, which can refer people to treatment or impose monetary fines.\n\nPortugal\u2019s radical drugs policy is working. Why hasn\u2019t the world copied it? Read more\n\nStatistics suggest the approach is working; Portugal has seen dramatic drops in overdose deaths, HIV infection rates and drug-related crimes, while the number of drug users seeking treatment has increased.\n\nShould the Liberals approve their resolution this week, decriminalisation would be backed by two of Canada\u2019s three major parties. But even so, there is little guarantee that the idea will make its way into the Liberal platform in the upcoming 2019 federal election. Trudeau, who leads the party, has repeatedly said his government is not considering legalising any other drugs besides marijuana.\n\nErskine-Smith stressed the difference between the two issues. The federal government\u2019s efforts to end marijuana prohibition aim to halt the flow of profits to organised crime, given that Canadians spent an estimated C$5.7 billion on marijuana last year.\n\nBut when it comes to decriminalisation, said Erskine-Smith, \u201cwe\u2019re not talking removing the criminal sanction for sale, we\u2019re not talking removing the criminal sanction for production, as we did with cannabis.\u201d\n\nThe change in approach comes with political risks, he acknowledged. Canada\u2019s Conservative party remains staunchly opposed to the idea and have shown themselves willing to exploit fears over the proposal to gain votes.\n\nLast year the party\u2019s leader Andrew Scheer attacked Trudeau on Twitter, alleging that his government was considering decriminalisation drugs beside marijuana.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny. When you talk to conservative members of Parliament one-on-one, I think they\u2019re open to the idea,\u201d said Erskine-Smith. \u201cBut my hope is \u2013 especially when confronted with the numbers of Canadians who have lost their lives, and we\u2019re talking Canadians of all backgrounds, Canadians of all political parties \u2013 I really do hope we\u2019re all able to get past the politics of it and follow the evidence.\u201d",

        "article.text": "The fact that Facebook probably has a profile of you whether you\u2019re a Facebook user or not might come as a surprise to some users, though today even the company\u2019s chief executive denied knowledge of the practice \u2014 or at least the term used to describe it.\n\nIn this morning\u2019s hearing with the House Energy and Commerce Committee, New Mexico Representative Ben Lujan cornered Mark Zuckerberg with a question about so-called \u201cshadow profiles\u201d \u2014 the term often used to refer to the data that Facebook collects on non-users and other hidden data that Facebook holds but does not offer openly on the site for users to see.\n\nIn one of the handful of slightly candid moments of the past few days, Rep. Lujan pressed Zuckerberg on the practice today:\n\nLujan: Facebook has detailed profiles on people who have never signed up for Facebook, yes or no? Zuckerberg: Congressman, in general we collect data on people who have not signed up for Facebook for security purposes to prevent the kind of scraping you were just referring to [reverse searches based on public info like phone numbers]. Lujan: So these are called shadow profiles, is that what they\u2019ve been referred to by some? Zuckerberg: Congressman, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not familiar with that. Lujan: I\u2019ll refer to them as shadow profiles for today\u2019s hearing. On average, how many data points does Facebook have on each Facebook user? Zuckerberg: I do not know off the top of my head. Lujan: Do you know how many points of data Facebook has on the average non-Facebook user? Zuckerberg: Congressman, I do not know off the top of my head but I can have our team get back to you afterward. Lujan: It\u2019s been admitted by Facebook that you do collect data points on non-[Facebook users]. My question is, can someone who does not have a Facebook account opt out of Facebook\u2019s involuntary data collection? Zuckerberg: Anyone can turn off and opt out of any data collection for ads, whether they use our services or not, but in order to prevent people from scraping public information\u2026 we need to know when someone is repeatedly trying to access our services. Lujan: It may surprise you that we\u2019ve not talked about this a lot today. You\u2019ve said everyone controls their data, but you\u2019re collecting data on people who are not even Facebook users who have never signed a consent, a privacy agreement. And it may surprise you that on Facebook\u2019s page when you go to \u201cI don\u2019t have a Facebook account and would like to request all my personal data stored by Facebook\u201d it takes you to a form that says \u201cgo to your Facebook page and then on your account settings you can download your data.\u201d So you\u2019re directing people that don\u2019t even have a Facebook page to sign up for a Facebook page to access their data\u2026 We\u2019ve got to change that.\n\nAs TechCrunch\u2019s Natasha Lomas explained during a 2013 Facebook privacy scandal:\n\nChances are someone you have corresponded with \u2014 by email or mobile phone \u2014 has let Facebook\u2019s data spiders crawl through their correspondence, thereby allowing your contact data to be assimilated entirely without your knowledge or consent.\n\nDuring that privacy breach, Facebook exposed the email addresses and phone numbers of six million users, though it later became apparent that a chunk of those accounts were never handed over to the platform directly by Facebook users. This information can be drawn into Facebook\u2019s vast data aggregation machine through friends or friends of friends via all kinds of channels, including the \u201cfind friends\u201d feature that allows the app to scan mobile contacts.\n\nFor all of Zuckerberg\u2019s claims that Facebook users own their data, users \u2014 and non-users \u2014 have no way of determining the full trove of data that the company stores on an individual. As Rep. Lujan was suggesting, it\u2019s likely that the Facebook data users are able to view on the platform is likely only the tip of the company\u2019s immense data iceberg.",

        "article.text": "Conservationists are mourning the death of 11 lions that were killed with poison in a national park in Uganda.\n\nThe three lionesses and eight cubs are thought to be victims of villagers who blame wildlife for killing a cow.\n\nThe Uganda Wildlife Authority said it was launching an investigation after the pride was found dead at the Queen Elizabeth National Park.\n\nIt is believed only 19 lions are now left in the park, and experts warned of potential extinction across Africa.\n\nThere were immediate calls for \u201cdomestic animals\u201d to be banned from the park and for the authority to compensate farmers whose cattle are killed by big cats in an effort to prevent future revenge attacks on wildlife.\n\nConservationists are worried the lion population in Africa is falling. A 2013 survey found the population had dropped by 30 per cent, and numbers in Uganda are now estimated at 400. The park is one of the last strongholds of the big cats in the country.\n\nWildlife experts also say the lions\u2019 natural prey is declining, while the number of humans is rising and encroaching on lions\u2019 traditional roaming areas, leading to greater conflict over land use.\n\nThe authority told The Independent: \u201cInvestigations will confirm the type of poison that was used. Investigations should lead to the identification, arrest and prosecution of the people behind this heinous act.\u201d\n\nHon Centenary Robert: 11 lions were poisoned in Queen Elizabeth National Park. We are left with only 19; this is going to affect our tourism and hinder our competitiveness. The communities bringing domestic animals in the protected areas should be dealth with. #PlenaryUg \u2014 Parliament of Uganda (@Parliament_Ug) April 12, 2018\n\nBut a spokesman denied natural prey was in decline. \u201cThe challenge is that there are people who graze cattle in the wildlife sanctuary so lions can easily prey on the cows. We have more than enough natural prey for the big cats,\u201d he said.\n\nRichard Kamara, a ranger with the authority, posted on Facebook: \u201cThe solution should be that all communities living within the park MUST not have any domestic animal, or else communities be relocated to other areas outside protected area.\u201d\n\nMark Jones, associate director of the Born Free Foundation in the UK, said: \u201cUganda\u2019s lions face an uncertain future, and cannot withstand these kinds of incidents.\n\n\"These animals need protecting from revenge killing and poaching through robust law enforcement, efforts to help local people live alongside wildlife without conflict, and ending the trade in their body parts.\n\n\"Without robust and swift action, the unimaginable disappearance of lions from Uganda and many other African countries they have called home for millennia, could become a cold reality.\u201d\n\nBashir Hangi, communications manager for the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said a compensation project existed in that area but the authority hoped to have it enshrined in law.\n\n\u201cIn the area where the lions were poisoned, there is a mechanism of compensating people; we are the people who can testify that they were compensated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe want a harmonious co-existence between wildlife conservation management and communities because we are all stakeholders in protecting wildlife.\n\n\u201cWe are reviewing the UWA Act to put in place punitive measures for poachers, traffickers and all those found guilty of killing wildlife.\n\n\u201cAlso we are proposing to include compensation for people in the Act. So it is still under review until when it is discussed by parliament and passed.\u201d\n\nThe poisonings come just six weeks after the UN's World Wildlife Day focused on big cats and efforts to protect them.\n\nThe Uganda Carnivore Program, which works to save lions, leopards and hyenas, said: \u201cHabitat loss due to human settlement and agriculture development, loss of prey population, and retaliatory killing by humans following livestock depredation are their main threats throughout Africa.\u201d\n\nWorld news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51 show all World news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/51 16 April 2018 People participate in a protest against the rape of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua near Jammu, and a teenager in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh state, in Bangalore, India Reuters\n\n2/51 15 April 2018 Fireworks are set off as the final performance takes place during the Closing Ceremony for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

        "article.text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In the days after the poisoning, specialist officers wore protective suits at the scene in Salisbury\n\nThe international chemical weapons watchdog has confirmed the UK's analysis of the type of nerve agent used in the Russian ex-spy poisoning.\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons did not name the nerve agent as Novichok, but said it agreed with the UK's findings on its identity.\n\nRussia, which denies it was behind the attack in Salisbury, called the allegations an \"anti-Russian campaign\".\n\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson said: \"There can be no doubt what was used.\"\n\nHe added: \"There remains no alternative explanation about who was responsible - only Russia has the means, motive and record.\"\n\nBut Maria Zakharova, from the Russian Foreign Ministry, said the allegations in relation to the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal were a \"clear anti-Russian campaign, the like of which we have not seen in the world for a long time in terms of its scale and lack of principles\".\n\nShe accused the British authorities of ignoring the \"norms of international law, the principles and laws of diplomacy, the elementary rules of human ethics\".\n\nAnd she claimed no one except for British authorities had seen the Skripals for more than a month.\n\nShe drew comparisons with the case of Alexander Litvinenko, the ex-KGB agent who died in 2006 in London, adding that at least a photograph of Litvinenko had appeared after his poisoning.\n\nA team from the OPCW visited the UK on 19 March, 15 days after the Skripals were found slumped on a park bench in Salisbury and taken to hospital, along with a police officer who was among the first on the scene.\n\nMs Skripal was discharged from hospital on Monday but the 33-year-old has said her father is \"still seriously ill\".\n\nImage caption Sergei Skripal remains in hospital but his daughter Yulia has been discharged\n\nThe OPCW said it received information about the medical conditions of the Skripals and Det Sgt Nick Bailey, it collected their blood samples, and it gathered samples from the site in Salisbury.\n\nMr Johnson said the UK had invited the OPCW to test the samples \"to ensure strict adherence to international chemical weapons protocols\".\n\nUK inspectors from the defence research facility at Porton Down in Wiltshire first identified the nerve agent as belonging to the Novichok group.\n\nWhat are Novichok agents?\n\nThe name Novichok means \"newcomer\" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nNovichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He says the nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors.\n\nNovichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder.\n\nSome of the agents are also said to be \"binary weapons\", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle.\n\nWhen these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea.\n\nThe OPCW does identify the toxic chemical by its complex formula but only in the classified report that has not been made public.\n\nIn its summary, which has been published online, the report notes the toxic chemical was of \"high purity\".\n\nThe BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said: \"This is understood to strengthen the argument that this substance came from Russia because it is more likely to have been created by a state actor with the capability to make the nerve agent.\"\n\nThe report does not name the source of the nerve agent, a subject which is beyond the remit of the inspectors.\n\nThe UK has called for a UN Security Council meeting on the OPCW report, likely to be held next week.",

        "article.text": "Photo: Getty\n\nAmong the unanswered questions at Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s congressional hearings this week, the CEO was a bit stumped when asked if he would be willing to change Facebook\u2019s business model in order to protect users\u2019 privacy. Facebook\u2019s data collection has received a lot of attention from a security perspective, but a new report illustrates why we should be just as concerned about how it uses that data to influence our behavior.\n\nThe Intercept has obtained what it claims is a recent document that describes a new service being offered to Facebook\u2019s advertising clients. Going beyond micro-targeting ads based on what it knows about your past and present, the social media company is now reportedly offering to use its artificial intelligence to predict what you will do in the future\u2014and giving clients the opportunity to intervene through a barrage of influence. From the report:\n\nOne slide in the document touts Facebook\u2019s ability to \u201cpredict future behavior,\u201d allowing companies to target people on the basis of decisions they haven\u2019t even made yet. This would, potentially, give third parties the opportunity to alter a consumer\u2019s anticipated course. Here, Facebook explains how it can comb through its entire user base of over 2 billion individuals and produce millions of people who are \u201cat risk\u201d of jumping ship from one brand to a competitor. These individuals could then be targeted aggressively with advertising that could pre-empt and change their decision entirely \u2014 something Facebook calls \u201cimproved marketing efficiency.\u201d This isn\u2019t Facebook showing you Chevy ads because you\u2019ve been reading about Ford all week \u2014 old hat in the online marketing world \u2014 rather Facebook using facts of your life to predict that in the near future, you\u2019re going to get sick of your car. Facebook\u2019s name for this service: \u201cloyalty prediction.\u201d\n\nFacebook is reportedly using its FBLearner Flow technology to drive this new initiative. The tool was first introduced in 2016 as Facebook\u2019s next step in machine learning and in since then it\u2019s been discussed as a way to improve people\u2019s experience on the platform rather than a way to improve marketing. Any time Zuckerberg was asked for a solution to a tough problem by a member of Congress this week, his response was some variation on \u201cbetter AI will solve it.\u201d Well, the company calls FBLearner Flow the \u201cbackbone\u201d of its AI initiative and it introduces plenty of problems of its own.\n\nFor years, advertising has relied on a few core principles and a handful of tools. There are essentially two kinds of businesses: those that recognize a problem and offer a solution, and those that have a solution and want to introduce a problem that people didn\u2019t really have before. Advertising is useful for both, but it\u2019s essential for the latter. It\u2019s well-understood that ad execs prey on people\u2019s insecurities and concoct unnecessary desires to shape their behavior. And for a long time, that business was conducted through gut feelings, limited market research, and a little dash of Freud. The era of Big Data changes that.\n\nSomeone might lie or withhold the truth from a marketing survey, but they spill their guts inside their private \u201cplace for friends.\u201d Online users betray their true instincts as they travel around the web tracked by cookies and walk around the real world bugged by the GPS in their phones. Now we have facial recognition, ubiquitous cameras, microphones, and fingerprint scanners to worry about. Even so, the billions of data points about billions of people couldn\u2019t be effectively parsed by humans, so we have machines go through it, categorize it and analyze it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you keep up with the marketing or tech business, you probably think you understand that. Check out tech Twitter to see people smugly explaining that we\u2019ve known everything bad about Facebook since forever. But just because knowledge is around doesn\u2019t mean that everyone understands it, or has received it, or has been convinced to accept it as true. The Intercept is detailing further developments about a tool that would, of course, be used for marketing purposes but has barely been discussed in that light.\n\nIt\u2019s worth hammering home just how consequential it is that an algorithm is slowly being trained to be extremely good at making behavioral predictions, extremely good at monitoring how those predictions play out, and extremely good at adjusting based on its failures and successes. When that same system is trained to modify your behavior through advertising, it\u2019s going to learn how to do it well. It\u2019s equally troubling that Facebook will have a monetary incentive to make its predictions come true. Frank Pasquale, a scholar at Yale\u2019s Information Society Project, pointed out to The Intercept that it\u2019s entirely possible that AI predictions will become \u201cself-fulfilling prophecies.\u201d\n\nSay that Facebook tells a client that its system predicts 10,000 people will stop buying name-brand detergent this year. It goes to all of the name-brand detergent advertisers, tells them its prediction, and they all decide not to run Facebook ads. Over the course of a year, Facebook has an incentive to make that prediction come true by tilting what you see in a way that might persuade you not to buy name-brand detergent. Pasquale notes that this is akin to a machine learning \u201cprotection racket.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the common lines of questioning that Zuckerberg received from Congress this week was whether or not it provides all of the data it possesses on a user through its \u201cdownloading your info\u201d tool. Zuckerberg was evasive and took advantage of his inquisitors\u2019 lack of technical knowledge\u2014always saying that\u2019s his \u201cunderstanding\u201d or hedging with \u201cyour\u201d data. He was asked directly: \u201cIf I download my Facebook information, is there other information accessible to you within Facebook that I wouldn\u2019t see on that document, such as browsing history or other inferences that Facebook has drawn from users for advertising purposes?\u201d His response was \u201cCongressman, I believe that all of your information is in that\u2014that file.\u201d He can get away with that answer because Facebook doesn\u2019t consider its inferences regarding your data as belonging to you. It would be crazy interesting to find out what Facebook thinks we\u2019re going to do in the future, but that would ruin the whole gambit because you\u2019d have it in the back of your mind when making those decisions.\n\nBy its own admission, Facebook is unable to adequately address many of the negative consequences of its scale. \u201cThe reality of a lot of this is that when you are building something like Facebook that is unprecedented in the world, there are going to be things that you mess up,\u201d Zuckerberg told reporters in a conference call last week. Things it has \u201cmessed up\u201d include aiding foreign actors in a propaganda campaign to interfere in the 2016 US election and being a conduit for ethnic cleansing in Myanmar. If you follow the news, you know that there many, many more examples. It\u2019s not hard to imagine things going terribly wrong when Facebook fulfills its dream of deploying its own mini-version of the internet in regions of the world that don\u2019t have it, and then proceeds to nudge people in whatever direction the highest bidder demands.\n\nFacebook did not respond to The Intercept\u2019s questions regarding whether or not these predictive behavior tools are currently offered to clients working on political campaigns or healthcare. We\u2019ve also requested an answer to that question and will update this post if and when we receive a reply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Facebook isn\u2019t the only company to worry about, everyone is working on machine learning in one way or another. For now, AI systems will be clumsy, but likely superior to old-fashioned market research. When machine learning really comes into its own, it could hold tremendous power over our dumb monkey brains. It will be like the difference between a musket and a rocket launcher. We should really consider whether we to continue in this direction, largely oblivious thanks to corporate secrecy.\n\nUpdate: Facebook provided this almost completely unrelated response to our inquiry: \u201cFacebook, just like many other ad platforms, uses machine learning to show the right ad to the right person. We don\u2019t claim to know what people think or feel, nor do we share an individual\u2019s personal information with advertisers.\u201d\n\n[The Intercept]",

        "article.text": "Aleksandr Kogan collected direct messages sent to and from Facebook users who installed his This Is Your Digital Life app, the Guardian can reveal. It follows Facebook\u2019s admission that the company \u201cmay\u201d have handed over the direct messages of some users to the Cambridge Analytica contractor without their express permission. The revelation is the most severe breach of privacy yet in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nThe social network admitted to the transfer of data in its warning to users whose friends had installed the This Is Your Digital Life app, which harvested data from not only the installer, but also all their friends on the site.\n\n\u201cA small number of people who logged into This Is Your Digital Life also shared their own news feed, timeline, posts and messages, which may have included posts and messages from you,\u201d the company told affected users.\n\nFollowing publication of this article, Kogan and Facebook contacted the Guardian. Kogan said he had never collected private message data for any commercial purpose of his business Global Science Research (GSR). He said private messages were only ever used for university work within his lab, for which Cambridge University ethics approval had been obtained.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson said: \u201cIn 2014, Facebook\u2019s platform policy allowed developers to request mailbox permissions but only if the person explicitly gave consent for this to happen. At the time when people provided access to their mailboxes - when Facebook messages were more of an inbox and less of a real-time messaging service - this enabled things like desktop apps that combined Facebook messages with messages from other services like SMS so that a person could access their messages all in one place. According to our records only a very small number of people explicitly opted into sharing this information. The feature was turned off in 2015.\u201d\n\nThe Facebook admission that the company may have handed over direct messages of some users appears to echo previously unreported claims made by Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower. Wylie told the Observer that he had seen a table, produced by Kogan, that included private messages. It remains unclear whether GSR, Kogan\u2019s company, or Cambridge Analytica ever used the messages to build any targeting models.\n\nPrior to, and after, publication of this article Kogan referred the Guardian to an interview with the New York Times in which he said his app collected information from a \u201ccouple thousand\u201d people, and that the data \u201cwas obviously sensitive so we tried to be careful about who could access it\u201d.\n\nKogan told the New York Times that he took messages only from people who had installed his app, not their friends, and that none of the information was shared with Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\n\nFor users who did not install the app, only their messages with the friend who had actively installed the app could have been shared, owing to the specific functionality offered by Facebook at the time. But those users would not have been offered any opportunity to opt out of the data sharing, since Facebook required the mailbox owner only to consent to uploading the entire contents, both sent and received.\n\nFor the users who did install the app, potentially their entire mailbox history was uploaded. Those users, however, would have been explicitly notified \u2013 through a simple clickthrough panel listing all the permissions they were handing over \u2013 that they were granting mailbox access.\n\nThe potential that Facebook may have handed over direct messages was first publicly highlighted in late March by Jonathan Albright, a professor at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism. On 21 March he noted that apps such as Kogan\u2019s \u201ccould also request users\u2019 private messages [ie their Facebook DM inbox] via the \u2018read_mailbox\u2019 API request\u201d. Albright said at the time that Facebook should \u201cimmediately\u201d share the API access that it had granted Kogan, as well as whether or not private messages were collected.\n\nSpeaking yesterday, Albright said: \u201cHave to admit, I didn\u2019t expect private DMs/messages to show up in people\u2019s CA notifications today \u2026 Might explain why FB late getting these [notifications] out?\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 16 April 2018 to add statements by Aleksandr Kogan and Facebook.\n\n",

        "article.text": "A tense dinner. Bad food. Vomiting back at the hotel room. Scenes from Russian whistleblower Alexander Perepilichnyy's last night alive, as the woman he spent that evening with finally told authorities her story after being tracked down by BuzzFeed News.\n\nRussian whistleblower Alexander Perepilichnyy spent the night before his death vomiting after eating food that tasted \u201cbad\u201d at an exclusive restaurant, his secret lover told his inquest. Perepilichnyy, who fled to the UK after blowing the whistle on a massive Kremlin-linked fraud, dropped dead outside his home in Surrey in 2012 after a secret trip to Paris to visit a Ukrainian model and fashion designer, Elmira Medynska. The police never interviewed Medynska, and she was called to testify at the inquest only after BuzzFeed News tracked her down. Today Medynska finally gave authorities her account of his final evening. Perepilichnyy was in a tense mood as they dined on sushi and tempura together at the Buddha Bar in Paris the night before his death, she told the inquest, demanding that he sit facing the restaurant\u2019s customers and twice sending food back because it seemed off to him. Perepilichnyy seemed \u201cvery stressed,\u201d Medynska said, and she had \u201ca very bad feeling\u201d. When they returned to their hotel, Perepilichnyy went straight to the bathroom and started vomiting repeatedly. His eyes and face were red and his skin was \u201cvery shiny\u201d when he came out, Medynska said, but he declined to call for a doctor. Last summer, BuzzFeed News revealed that the British government was suppressing explosive intelligence provided by US spy agencies indicating that Perepilichnyy was assassinated on the orders of Russian president Vladimir Putin. The government has now opened a review into his death and 13 other suspected assassinations exposed by BuzzFeed News that authorities had previously ignored.\n\nUK police have long insisted that there is no evidence of foul play in Perepilichnyy\u2019s death \u2014 despite the fact that his name was found on a Russian hit list and he received a string of threats in his final months \u2013 and the Home Office has invoked national security powers to withhold evidence from the inquest. Police have said that they never interviewed Medynska \u2014 nor searched the hotel room the two stayed at \u2014 because, they told the inquest, it would be an unnecessary \u201cfishing trip.\u201d And when the previous hearing began last June, Medynska was not scheduled to testify. But she was called as a witness after BuzzFeed News found her and obtained details of Perepilichnyy\u2019s final days. In an exclusive interview, she said Perepilichnyy had been stressed out on the day before his death: He kept going outside to take mysterious phone calls, his \u201chands were shaking\u201d, and he was drinking \u201clots of wine\u201d. After the BuzzFeed News revelations about Medynska and about the intelligence linking Perepilichnyy\u2019s death to the Kremlin, the inquest was suspended for 10 months, beginning again this week \u2014 and today Medynska was summoned to testify via a video link from Paris. She wore a black dress with a blazer draped over her shoulders, her once-blonde hair now auburn and pulled back into a bun. She told the court that she had met Perepilichnyy, a tall, tousle-haired 44-year-old, in the spring of 2012 on a dating website. They met up in Kiev, where she was living at the time, and spent two days together. He told her he used to work in Moscow but \u201cdidn\u2019t feel good there\u201d and moved to London for a more \u201ceasy life\u201d, but he was vague about what exactly he did for business. Perepilichnyy returned to London, and they kept in touch, Perepilichnyy using an email account with a pseudonym. \u201cI think he wanted some privacy,\u201d she told the court, \u201cand I didn\u2019t ask him so many questions.\u201d At a bistro lunch during a summer assignation in the south of France, Medynska testified, Perepilichnyy took a phone call, walked out into the street, and started screaming into the receiver. \u201cI ask him if everything is fine when he comes back,\u201d Medynska testified, \u201cand he says, \u2018Yes, it is just the work.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey arranged to meet for the third and final time at the Hotel Bristol in Paris that November. As it happened, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was in town and staying at the very same spot. Medynska repeated to the inquest what she told BuzzFeed News \u2014 that when they had lunch together, Perepilichnyy seemed nervous, his shaky hands spilling wine down his front. \u201cHe was in another planet so I was a little bit upset, and so he said, \u2018let\u2019s go shopping together,\u2019\u201d Medynska said. Yet as Medynska chose shoes, Perepilichnyy was checking his email. Lawyers at the inquest questioned Medynska closely about everything Perepilichnyy ate that day. When they returned to the hotel, Medynska testified, he ate a couple of apples. \u201cI was saying, \u2018Alexander, it\u2019s nice that you eat apples,\u2019 because he very takes care of his health if he eats apples,\u201d Medynska said. At around 10pm, they went to a noisy Asian fusion restaurant called Buddha Bar for dinner. Medynska found it odd that he seemed nervous and refused to sit with his back to the restaurant\u2019s other patrons, most of whom seemed to be \u201cvery old French people\u201d. His eyes kept wandering to the stairs. A lawyer at the inquest noted that he had made bookings for the same night at a series of other restaurants that the two did not go to. When Perepilichnyy tried some of the food, his mood turned sour. She couldn\u2019t remember exactly which dish upset him, she said, because she had gone to the restroom twice to wash her hands and to phone her mother, but she thought it was \u201csomething fried, like tempura.\u201d They shared a bottle of white wine, and at the end of the meal he said he wanted some fresh air. Outside on the street, he felt better. They held hands as they made the short walk back to the hotel. But when they got to their room, he went straight to the toilet, where he stayed for an hour. He started running the water, but it did not obscure the sound of vomiting, which she heard three times. She said she did not actually see him throw up or confirm that was what he had been doing \"because I cannot ask a man, have you vomited?\" He seemed better when he came out, and in the morning, nothing seemed amiss. \u201cHe smiled, he invite me for the breakfast, we went to the first floor and went for eggs and bread and hot chocolate,\u201d she said.\n\nHe told her he wanted to see her again, perhaps in Switzerland a month later, and they parted ways, Medynska testified. When she got home, she sent him a message \u201capologising for my behaviour because I was very cold with him.\u201d But she never heard back, and that same day, Perepilichnyy returned to his home in Surrey, where he collapsed and died while out for a jog. Two days later, Medynska testified, she got a curious phone call from a British number. \u201cThey told me that Alexander is in hospital because he had a car accident,\u201d she said, and they said her number was in his phone. She got a similar call again the next day. \u201cI thought it was a bad joke,\u201d she said. She sent him an email asking how he was doing. Months later, she received a response from someone using Perepilichnyy\u2019s email address saying she would \u201cdie soon\u201d. Medynska said that for a while she was in the dark about what actually happened to Perepilichnyy. She learned the truth on New Year\u2019s Eve of that year, when she read it on the internet. \u201cI was very scared,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause the last person to see him in Paris was me.\u201d The inquest continues.\n\nJane Bradley is an investigations correspondent for BuzzFeed News and is based in London.

        "article.text": "Then late Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to shift gears again, saying in a Twitter post at 11:15 p.m. that he would consider re-entering the agreement only if it were \u201csubstantially better\u201d than the deal offered to President Barack Obama. \u201cWe already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations, Japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years!\u201d\n\n[Even longtime American allies expressed skepticism about the United States returning to the trade pact. Read about current members\u2019 reactions to President Trump\u2019s remarks.]\n\nThe discussion on the trade deal began at the White House meeting earlier on Thursday, when Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, questioned Mr. Trump about returning to the pact, arguing that the Trans-Pacific Partnership was the best way to put pressure on China.\n\nMr. Trump, who has put China\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d trade practices in his cross hairs, turned to Mr. Kudlow and Robert Lighthizer, his trade negotiator, and asked them to look into re-entering the agreement.\n\nRejoining the pact could be a significant change in fortune for many American industries that stood to benefit from the trade accord and for Republican lawmakers who supported it. The deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration, was largely intended as a tool to prod China into making the type of economic changes that the United States and others have long wanted. Many economists say the best way to combat a rising China and pressure it to open its market is through multilateral trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which create favorable trading terms for participants.\n\n\u201cThe idea was to set a framework that eventually China would have to accommodate,\u201d said David Autor, an economist at M.I.T.\n\nFarmers would stand to benefit from new access to markets, especially Japan, if Mr. Trump rejoins the pact. For instance, ranchers in Australia can currently send beef to Japan more cheaply than ranchers in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMichael Miller, the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates and a farmer in Washington, said rejoining the deal would allow his industry to compete on a level playing field with competitors in Australia and Canada, which both remained in the accord.\n\nBut rejoining it could be a complex task. The remaining countries, like Japan, moved ahead without the United States, and spent months renegotiating a pact before finally agreeing to a sweeping multinational deal this year. Mr. Trump, who has demanded that any such deal benefit the United States, is unlikely to rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership without further concessions for what he has criticized as a terrible agreement. That could complicate talks, since Japan maintains that it has already given all the concessions it could, said William A. Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Get the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.

View all New York Times newsletters.\n\nYoshihide Suga, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary, on Friday cautioned against any efforts to change the agreement to accommodate Mr. Trump, calling it a \u201cwell-balanced pact\u201d that addressed the needs of the 11 nations that signed the deal.\n\nIt is also unclear how serious Mr. Trump is about rejoining. In the past, the president has floated policies that appeared to run counter to his earlier positions, like cooperating with Democrats on legislation governing immigration and gun rights, then quickly abandoned them.\n\n\u201cWhat he tells people in a room to make them happy does not always translate into administration policy,\u201d said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\n\nIn a statement, a deputy White House press secretary, Lindsay Walters, pushed back on the notion that Mr. Trump was reversing his promises.\n\nThe president had \u201ckept his promise to end the TPP deal negotiated by the Obama administration because it was unfair to American workers and farmers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president has consistently said he would be open to a substantially better deal.\u201d\n\nBut the White House is in somewhat of a box when it comes to prodding China to fall in line with global trade rules. The administration is trying to use tariffs to force Beijing to open its markets, but many of his supporters, including business groups and farmers, fear the fallout from an escalating trade war will be even more damaging. China has responded to Mr. Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs on as much as $150 billion worth of its goods by placing its own tariffs on American pork, and threatening taxes on soybeans, sorghum, corn and beef.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome advisers, including Mr. Kudlow, have indicated that those tariffs may never go into effect, and that they are mainly a prelude to negotiations with the Chinese, statements that have helped calm volatile stock markets. In a recent note to clients, the ratings agency Fitch said that the most likely outcome to the conflict remained a \u201cnegotiated solution\u201d and that it was therefore not changing its primary economic forecast.\n\nMr. Kudlow, in the interview, said that farmers had \u201ca legitimate concern\u201d but added that it would be \u201cat least two months before final decisions will be made.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to say we won\u2019t use tariffs \u2014 everything\u2019s on the table in these negotiations \u2014 but I am here to say we don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, White House officials suggest that little to no progress has yet been made in bridging contentious gaps with the Chinese. Administration officials say that back-channel talks have occurred, but they would not characterize them as official negotiations. The Chinese appear impassable on some of the issues that the White House is most concerned about, including their subsidies to cutting-edge industries like robotics, aerospace and artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Trump administration says it has ordered the Agriculture Department to create a program to help farmers should the two nations find themselves in a trade war. Trade advisers say the department could draw on the financial resources of a program known as the Commodity Credit Corporation, which provides up to $30 billion to help shore up American farmers by buying their crops.\n\n\u201cStay with us while we go through this difficult process,\u201d Mr. Kudlow told farm-state representatives during the meeting, according to a White House transcript. He added, \u201cAnd at the end, if the worst case has come out as the president said, you will be helped. That\u2019s a promise.\u201d\n\nBut such a program would be time-consuming and costly and would come as the budget deficit continues to increase. Farmers say that Mr. Trump\u2019s threats have already hurt them by causing the price of futures contracts to fall. They maintain that the easiest way to help them is to avoid a trade war with China in the first place.\n\nSenator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, described the meeting with the president as \u201cproductive\u201d and said that she had urged him to re-engage in discussions with countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. \u201cIowa farmers aren\u2019t looking for another subsidy program; rather they want new and improved market access,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe best thing the United States can do to push back against Chinese cheating now is to lead the other 11 Pacific nations that believe in free trade and the rule of law,\u201d Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, who attended the meeting, said in a statement. \u201cIt is good news that today the president directed Larry Kudlow and Ambassador Lighthizer to negotiate U.S. entry into TPP.\u201d",

        "article.text": "The data consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which harvested as many as 87 million Facebook users' personal data, also could have accessed the private inbox messages of some of those affected. Facebook slipped this previously undisclosed detail into the notifications that began appearing at the top of News Feeds on Monday. These alerts let users know whether they or their friends had downloaded a personality quiz app called This Is Your Digital Life, which would have caused their data to be collected and potentially passed on to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFacebook buried the disclosure in the details about what information was compromised: \"A small number of people who logged into 'This Is Your Digital Life' also shared their own News Feed, timeline, posts and messages which may have included posts and messages from you.\"\n\n'The harvesting of personal Facebook messages wasn't disclosed, yet again, until the last second.' Jonathan Albright, Columbia University\n\nA Facebook spokesperson confirmed that the app, which was designed by Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan to collect data on Americans on behalf of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s British counterpart SCL, requested access to user inboxes through the read_mailbox permission. Unlike the collection of specific user friend information, which Facebook says it phased out in April 2015 unless both people had downloaded the same app, the read_mailbox permission didn't fully deprecate until that October.\n\nUsers had to agree to give apps access to their inboxes, but that request for highly personal information would be bundled up with a list of other more benign data points, including birthdays or profile pictures. It's possible some users approved this access, never knowing how much of themselves they were giving up, not just to Cambridge Analytica, but to every app that requested these permissions until 2015.\n\nFacebook says that a total of 1,500 people granted This Is Your Digital Life permission, although the total number of people affected remains unknown. Anyone who messaged those 1,500 people\u2014or received messages from those 1,500\u2014on Facebook at the time would be potentially impacted.\n\nCambridge Analytica denies having accessed that specific data. \"GSR did not share the content of any private messages with Cambridge Analytica or SCL Elections. Neither company has ever handled such data,\" a company spokesperson says.1\n\nStill, the ambiguous last-minute detail Facebook offered to users about this deeply sensitive issue irked critics of Facebook's privacy policies. \"The harvesting of personal Facebook messages wasn't disclosed, yet again, until the last second,\" says Jonathan Albright, research director at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia University, who has tracked Facebook's recent missteps. \"I suspect it'll be difficult to accurately reconcile the number of users affected due to the nature of [direct messages] and especially group messages.\"\n\nThis is just one more detail that Congress may ask Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to explain when he faces a joint Senate committee hearing Tuesday, followed by a House committee hearing Wednesday. While Zuckerberg and the company he runs have rushed to cast themselves as transparent in the wake of a massive data privacy scandal, the company has consistently slid ever more troubling information about the way users' information has been used into the fine print. Last week, toward the very end of a blog post on new restrictions for app developers, the company noted that 87 million people\u2019s data may have been exposed to Cambridge Analytica, 37 million more than had been publicly reported. Facebook also indicated in that post that most of its 2.2 billion users may have had their public profiles scraped using a feature that allowed people to search for other users with their phone numbers and email addresses.\n\nDuring a phone call with reporters, Zuckerberg stressed that this was all information that Facebook users \u201cchose to share,\u201d but that\u2019s not necessarily true when it comes to users\u2019 private messages. If one person in a conversation did agree\u2014even willingly\u2014to share their inboxes with an app, that doesn\u2019t mean the person on the other side of that conversation did. And yet, Facebook\u2019s permissions allowed apps to peek in at both sides of a conversation, a practice that continued for months after the company's touted Graph API overhaul in 2015. Unlike some profile information, which users may have unknowingly left public, there is an expectation of privacy that accompanies direct messages. That\u2019s why people send direct messages, rather than post publicly to a Facebook friend\u2019s timeline.\n\nGiven his recent change of heart, Zuckerberg may well acknowledge this as an oversight.

Trump wanted Mattis \u201cto push the limits a little bit more,\u201d a White House official told the Wall Street Journal, while Mattis was said to be reluctant.\n\nThe air strikes at multiple targets began around 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time (0100 GMT) and saw US, French and British assets firing missiles at the Assad regime\u2019s chemical production facilities.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to strike Syria in response to a suspected chemical attack came a year after he ordered military action against Assad following a deadly sarin gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun.\n\n\u201cClearly, the Assad regime did not get the message last year,\u201d Mattis said.\n\n\u201cThis time, the allies struck harder. We sent a clear message to Assad,\u201d he added, noting that double the number of weapons were deployed compared to last year, when 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired at Shayrat air base.\n\nThe air strikes appeared to last about an hour. Mattis said no additional attacks were planned, though Trump earlier suggested the strikes could last longer.\n\nGeneral Joe Dunford, who is chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the US chose targets to avoid hitting Russian forces.\n\nThe US military warned Russia of areas it would be operating in, but did not coordinate planning or targets, Dunford said.\n\nDunford added the precision strikes hit a scientific research center near Damascus, a storage facility and command post also near the capital and a chemical weapons storage facility near Homs.\n\nSyrian surface to air missile batteries had attempted to fire back, but there were no initial reports of any allied losses, he said.\n\nMattis and Dunford were joined at the Pentagon podium by British and French top officers.",

The incident took place on December 22, the army said, during protests in Gaza over Donald Trump\u2019s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\n\nThe distressing video, which has been subtitled by the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, was apparently recorded through binoculars or a gun scope, and captures the soldier who recorded it shouting as the protester is hit, \u201cYes!

The system is able to calculate the vehicle\u2019s energy consumption, which enables electricity costs to be debited per vehicle and user.\n\nThe \u201cdynamic charging\u201d \u2013 as opposed to the use of roadside charging posts \u2013 means the vehicle\u2019s batteries can be smaller, along with their manufacturing costs.\n\nA former diesel-fuelled truck owned by the logistics firm, PostNord, is the first to use the road.\n\nHans S\u00e4ll, chief executive of the eRoadArlanda consortium behind the project, said both current vehicles and roadways could be adapted to take advantage of the technology.\n\nIn Sweden there are roughly half a million kilometres of roadway, of which 20,000km are highways, S\u00e4ll said.\n\n\u201cIf we electrify 20,000km of highways that will definitely be be enough,\u201d he added. \u201cThe distance between two highways is never more than 45km and electric cars can already travel that distance without needing to be recharged. Some believe it would be enough to electrify 5,000km.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Building the eRoadArlanda: the government\u2019s roads agency has already drafted a national map for future expansion.

There are two tracks, just like an outlet in the wall. Five or six centimetres down is where the electricity is. But if you flood the road with salt water then we have found that the electricity level at the surface is just one volt. You could walk on it barefoot.\u201d\n\nNational grids are increasingly moving away from coal and oil and battery storage is seen as crucial to a changing the source of the energy used in transportation.\n\nThe Swedish government, represented by a minister at the formal inauguration of the electrified road on Wednesday, is in talks with Berlin about a future network. In 2016, a 2km stretch of motorway in Sweden was adapted with similar technology but through overhead power lines at lorry level, making it unusable for electric cars.\n\nThis article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.

        "article.text": "\"It is unprecedented - it has not happened anywhere else\"\n\nBy Anastasia Moloney\n\nBOGOTA, April 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indigenous communities that depend on Colombia's Amazon rainforest for their survival will have more say over their ancestral lands, as Colombia adds 8 million hectares to its protected areas in an effort to stem forest loss.\n\nThe new measures announced by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos on Tuesday aim to create a buffer zone for the country's southern Amazon region.\n\nFarmers are pushing deeper into forests, cutting down more trees to clear land for cattle-grazing and agriculture.\n\nSantos said the protected areas will be marked off in the next two weeks, meaning that \"once and for all, we (will) know where we can farm, produce - and from what boundary we will protect all the forests and the entire Amazon\".\n\nThis brings the total area of protected forests in Colombia to nearly 40 million hectares, Santos said in a speech in the Amazon town of Leticia, flanked by indigenous tribes and Norway's prime minister and environment minister.\n\nNorway, a key financial backer of Colombia's forest conservation efforts, said the new buffer zone was important to meet Colombia's goals of zero net deforestation by 2020, and halting the loss of all natural forest by 2030.\n\n\"It is unprecedented - it has not happened anywhere else, any other place at least that I know,\" Ola Elvestuen, Norway's new minister of climate and environment, said on this week's visit.\n\nReducing deforestation is crucial in the fight against climate change, Elvestuen added.\n\nWhen forests are degraded or destroyed, the carbon stored in the trees is released into the atmosphere, with deforestation accounting for 10 to 15 percent of carbon emissions worldwide.\n\nCOMMUNITY CASH\n\nUnder a decree signed by President Santos, Colombia's Amazon tribes will be able to decide through their own community councils how to spend government development funds in three provinces.\n\n\"Indigenous people have traditionally shown themselves to be the best keepers of rainforests,\" Elvestuen told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview.\n\nNorway said it would extend an agreement with Colombia by five years to 2025 under which Colombia gets payouts for meeting verified targets to reduce emissions by slowing deforestation.\n\nColombia will receive up to $50 million a year through 2025 under the deal, which could run until 2030, the minister said.\n\nThe payments are usually distributed to farmers, as well as community and indigenous groups and local environment authorities working on forest protection.\n\nColombia is home to rainforest roughly the size of Germany and England but is struggling to protect it. Deforestation rates in its Amazon region increased by 44 percent from 2015 to 2016.\n\nElvestuen said they could rise again in 2017 and 2018.\n\nSwathes of forests are being felled in areas vacated by rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as part of a 2016 peace deal signed with the government.\n\nAs the government tries to regain control of former FARC strongholds, farmers, illegal loggers and organised crime groups involved in drug trafficking and illegal mining are tapping into new places, including in the Amazon, Elvestuen said.\n\nColombia's top court earlier this month told the government to come up with plans within four months to combat rising deforestation in the Amazon.\n\n(Reporting by Anastasia Moloney @anastasiabogota, Editing by Megan Rowling.

        "article.text": "The Information Commissioner\u2019s Office is investigating Leave.EU and its donor Arron Banks over possible breaches of the Data Protection Act.\n\nThe ICO has issued \u201cinformation notices\u201d against both Leave.EU \u2013 the referendum campaign headed by Nigel Farage \u2013 and its director, Banks. The notices \u2013 requiring organisations to provide the ICO with specified information within a certain time period \u2013 were issued in the same week as the ICO conducted raids last month on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s offices. The notices are both part of Operation Cederburg \u2013 the commissioner\u2019s year-long investigation into the use of data in the EU referendum. Failure to comply is a criminal offence.\n\nBanks \u2013 who was by far the biggest funder of Brexit, providing \u00a38.4m in donations and loans \u2013 confirmed on Friday that both he personally and Leave.EU had received \u201cinformation notices\u201d. In an email on Friday, Banks said they were \u201cresponding to it\u2019\u201d He said the ICO\u2019s action was not an \u201cinvestigation\u201d but \u201can information request\u201d.\n\nIn a separate development, the Observer has obtained an invoice that Cambridge Analytica issued on 14 December 2015 for \u00a341,500 for work it undertook on behalf of Ukip. The invoice says the payment is for \u201canalysis of Ukip membership and survey data and creative product development\u201d, and it is issued on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC, the American entity, from its office in Alexandria, Virginia. This is the first documentary evidence that Cambridge Analytica did conduct analytics work on behalf of one of the Leave campaigns in the period before the referendum.\n\nBanks confirmed to the Observer that he was also sent the invoice at that time too. He said he subsequently made a donation for the amount to cover the invoice to Ukip. A spokesman for Ukip, speaking to the Guardian last month, denied any payment for the work was made but he confirmed Banks had in fact made the donation after \u201cnew information had come to light\u201d. He said that the party decided not to pass on the money to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nBanks has long denied that Cambridge Analytica did any work for Leave.EU, as has Cambridge Analytica. The question is still the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Electoral Commission. In a written submission to the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) last month, Banks said he had met Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica but that he had declined to take him up on his proposal. Cambridge Analytica said on Saturday that it \u201cdid some preliminary analysis as part of a proposal to work with Ukip, but no contract was agreed, payment was not made to CA, and the preliminary work was not delivered to Ukip.\u201d\n\nBrittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge Analytica director, who appeared on a panel at Leave.EU\u2019s launch event, came forward to the Guardian last month and raised further questions about these claims. She said the company had completed around \u00a340,000 worth of work for Ukip, using Ukip data, but agreed that the company had not been paid. She is expected to talk about this on Tuesday when she will testify to parliament as part of the DCMS committee into fake news.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ukip has confirmed it handed its database over to Cambridge Analytica. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA\n\nA Ukip spokesman told the Observer on Friday: \u201cWe got the money from Arron [Banks]. But we never paid it to Cambridge Analytica. We didn\u2019t think it was worth it. It was preparatory work, a pitch.\u201d\n\nHe also confirmed that the party had handed over its database of roughly 40,000 supporters to Cambridge Analytica despite denying this to the Guardian last month.\n\nUkip had told the Guardian previously that Cambridge Analytica \u201csaw\u201d the data but a spokesman admitted the information \u2013 including telephone numbers, email addresses, ages, and other personal information among other things \u2013 was given to the company on a computer as part of what he described as \u201cpreparatory work\u201d.\n\nThe spokesman said: \u201cI asked everyone about this work and I was told CA pitched for it, Banks didn\u2019t like it and he\u2019d refused to pay for it. It\u2019s now come out that he did actually make a donation to cover the cost of the work. But we never actually handed it over.\u201d\n\nThe revelations raise a whole new set of questions about how the referendum was funded and whether strict rules on spending may have been broken. The Observer has seen evidence which suggests that a form of the Ukip data that Cambridge Analytica analysed and processed was passed to individuals in the Leave.EU campaign. And a donation of \u00a342,000 from Better for the Country, Leave.EU\u2019s registered company name, was recorded as a political donation to the party on the Electoral Commission\u2019s site one week before the referendum on 16 June 2016. It was not registered as part of the campaign by either entity as a referendum donation or expense.\n\nThe unfolding of the Cambridge Analytica scandal has coincided with the final stages of the information commissioner\u2019s investigation into the use of data in the referendum. Leave.EU\u2019s operation has become one focus of the year-long investigation. Another resulted in the ICO\u2019s raid on Cambridge Analytica. Damian Collins, the Tory MP for Folkestone, who is the chair of the DCMS committee, has told the Observer that both Britain\u2019s electoral and data laws needed a radical and urgent overhaul. He said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d that the ICO had to wait five days before being able to get a warrant to seize Cambridge Analytica\u2019s computer servers and equipment.\n\nSeparately, the ICO investigation is believed to be trying to understand the relationship between Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance Services, the Bristol-based insurance company that Banks owns and that was the HQ for Leave.EU referendum campaign work. A spokesman said: \u201cLeave.EU and Eldon have never shared any data. And Leave.EU has never shared any data with Cambridge Analytica whether in relation to the EU referendum or otherwise.\u201d\n\nThe ICO may be asking questions because of previous comments Banks has made, including in an interview a year ago with the Observer. When asked about the use of Leave.EU\u2019s database to send advertisements about his insurance products to campaign supporters, Banks said: \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I? It\u2019s my data.\u201d When asked again last week, he said: \u201cLeave.EU after the referendum campaign carried the occasional ad for insurance, so what?\u201d\n\nIn an email on Friday he said: \u201cEldon has never given or used any data to Leave.EU. They are separate entities with strong data control rules. And vice versa.\u201d He added: \u201cMake any mistakes relating to the business and we will be most assuredly coming after the Guardian & you.\u201d",

        "article.text": "Reuters/Dado Ruvic\n\nSome dissatisfied Facebook engineers are attempting to switch divisions to work on the company's other products, like Instagram or WhatsApp, in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, The New York Times reported over the weekend.\n\nChristopher Wylie, the founder of the data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, told news outlets last month that the company had illegitimately obtained data from over 50 million Facebook profiles. Facebook has since revised that figure to as many as 87 million.\n\nFacebook says it was aware of the data Cambridge Analytica had and asked the company to delete it when it changed its advertising rules 2015, but it never followed up to ensure Cambridge Analytica had done so.\n\nMany have argued that Facebook could and should have handled the data more responsibly, and the increased scrutiny of Facebook has apparently taken a toll on employees working on the platform.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg have spoken to the media on a few occasions since news of the scandal broke, but it was days before the company commented on the scandal. Then late last month, a leaked 2016 memo from the Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth described a \"growth at all costs\" mentality at the company, piling on the recent backlash.\n\nAmid the uproar, some engineers working on Facebook's core product have found it increasingly difficult to stand by it. Westin Lohne, a former Facebook product designer, explained his dilemma in a tweet.\n\nLohne said in his tweets that he didn't choose to go to Instagram or WhatsApp and is now unemployed.\n\nZuckerberg is testifying before Congress on Tuesday, where he's expected to face questions about the company's role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

        "article.text": "Did Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump make a deal? Reuters\n\nPresident Donald Trump is said to be preparing to tip off the Russian military before launching any missile strike on Syria, so that Moscow can get its forces out of the way.\n\nThe Russian newspaper Kommersant reported on Wednesday that the US would give the Russian military a list of targets it intends to hit. The report said no high-value Russian assets like ships or planes were in the crosshairs.\n\nThe site also reports that Russia has spoken with US military leaders and with NATO (via Turkey) to avoid an escalating conflict as the West prepares to punish the Syrian government for a suspected chemical-weapons attack Saturday on a rebel-held town.\n\nCoordination between Russia and the US, the world's two greatest military and nuclear powers, would have positive implications for avoiding a massive escalation.\n\nBut it also raises questions of how significant a US strike can be without ruffling Russia's feathers and of how committed Russia is to protecting the Syrian government from Western attacks.\n\nTrump is planning a big strike, but not World War III\n\nUS Navy sailors load a Tomahawk cruise missile into a submarine. Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Samuel Souvannason/US Navy\n\nTrump did warn Russia before the US struck a Syrian air base in April of last year. He is thought to be exploring a much larger strike this time, as the strike in April 2017 didn't meaningfully hamper Syria's air operations. The air base the US hit with sea-based cruise missiles began launching aircraft again within 24 hours of the strike.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said \"all options are on the table,\" suggesting the US may strike Russian assets in Syria.\n\nExperts told Business Insider, however, that such a confrontation was unlikely.\n\n\"The Americans take pains to avoid striking targets that are Russian regulars,\" said Ryan Bohl, a Middle East analyst at the geopolitical consulting firm Stratfor. He distinguished between official, enlisted soldiers \u2014 known as regulars \u2014 and military contractors, whom the US has engaged in the past.\n\nAdditionally, Bohl said Syria's suspected chemical-weapons facilities were far enough away from Russian bases that they could be hit without upsetting Russian forces.\n\nThe idea of a coordinated, punitive strike on Syria runs counter to the narrative put forth by a Russian diplomat, who on Wednesday said Russia would shoot down any US missiles headed for Syria and potentially retaliate.\n\n\"I think that in the Syrian theater, Russia is unlikely to interfere with the coming US operation or take military steps to prevent it or in retribution, despite their comments,\" Cliff Kupchan, a former US State Department official who is now chairman of the Eurasia Group, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Russia's not spoiling in any sense for a military conflict,\" he continued, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin was \"ruthlessly rational in weighting cost-benefits.\"\n\nKupchan attributed Trump's tough rhetoric, in which he has called out Putin by name over Saturday's attack, to politics.\n\nRussia may know Syria has gone too far\n\nA child being treated for suspected chemical gas poisoning in Douma, Syria, on Sunday. The White Helmets/Twitter\n\nRussia has largely staked its credibility in the Middle East on saving Syrian President Bashar Assad's government from collapse during its bloody seven-year civil war.\n\nKupchan and others, however, told Business Insider it was an open secret that Russia didn't like Assad much.\n\nKupchan said the Kremlin may once have held influence over Assad, when there was a chance he could lose the ongoing civil war. But now that Assad's forces are dominant, Kupchan says, Russian has little influence over Assad, who brings negative attention to the alliance through his attacks on civilians, including with chemical weapons.\n\nJustin Bronk, an air-combat expert at the Royal United Services Institute, said chemical weapons killed fewer people than regular bombs but did so in a \"particularly terrifying\" way.\n\nIn Bronk's view, Russia most likely pressures Syria not to use chemical weapons, on the grounds that they raise the risk of a US strike and aren't needed militarily. But Assad uses them anyway, Bronk said, to \"depopulate\" rebel areas, as the fumes from the weapons seep into shelters where regular bombs can't reach \u2014 and where civilians including children often take refuge.\n\n\"I think the Russians have limited control over Assad,\" said Kupchan, who has met Putin several times. \"That's why they don't like him so much.\"\n\nUnanimously, experts who spoke with Business Insider agreed the US and Russia had a heavy interest in avoiding war between the two of them. Deconfliction lines between the US and Russia help.\n\nIf the US can strike Syria without hitting Russian troops and equipment, it could be as successful politically as the one last April, which went virtually unpunished and won Trump wide praise for his foreign-policy boldness.",

The report was published after opposition leader Alexei Navalny called for nationwide protests on May 5, two days ahead of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s inauguration.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Russians polled by the independent Levada Center have said that they are unwilling to take part in political protests.\n\nEighty-six percent of Russians surveyed by Levada late last month said they would not participate in political protests, against 8 percent who said they would.\n\nAnother 88 percent said they have not noticed any protests taking place in their town or district over the past several months.\n\n\u201cThe polls most likely indicate that people don\u2019t see any protests, while local demonstrations simply remain unnoticed by the majority,\u201d Levada sociologist Denis Volkov told the RBC business portal on Monday.\n\nReferring to protests after the deadly mall fire in Kemerovo and anti-landfill demonstrations outside Moscow, Volkov said that \u201cpeople are more likely to seek answers from the authorities than make political demands.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are problems, but there is no inclination to blame the central government, especially if the authorities try to respond and at least partially satisfy the demands of citizens,\u201d he was cited as saying.\n\nThe results track with past Levada surveys, which found that four-fifths of Russians would not have protested the March 2018 presidential elections, while just one-third of Muscovites who voted against a controversial housing demolition program said they would participate in street protests.\n\n\n\nThe latest survey was conducted among 1,600 Russians in 52 Russian regions between March 23 and March 27.",

Russia claims Crimeans wanted to separate from Ukraine and that it was acting defensively against the expansion of NATO, which the Kremlin believes wants Kiev to join its alliance.\n\nSince 2015, Russia has deployed troops to support the Assad regime in Syria\u2019s civil war after Western powers, including the U.S. and U.K., decided two years earlier not to fully intervene in the conflict on the side of moderate rebels fighting the government.\n\nThis is despite evidence of war crimes committed by the Assad regime, including a chemical weapons attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in 2017, which killed dozens. The United Nations said Assad\u2019s forces were to blame for the attack.\n\nAssad denies that his forces are responsible for another chemical attack in Douma on April 7, 2018, which killed dozens and injured hundreds more.\n\nRussia claims it found no evidence of a chemical attack at the scene as distressing reports, images and video footage emerged from the aftermath of the incident showing dead bodies, including children, foaming at the mouth.\n\nThe World Health Organization said its partners in the area reported around 500 people showing up at medical facilities displaying symptoms of exposure to toxic chemicals, and that the bodies of at least 43 people who died showed similar signs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pledged to respond to the Douma chemical attack with force against those responsible, which he says is the Assad regime. Russia warned of \u201cgrave consequences\u201d if any of its citizens are injured in military action against Syria by the U.S.\n\nPutin\u2019s Russia is also isolated diplomatically over the chemical attack on a former colonel in its military intelligence unit and his daughter on a street in England. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned with a Russian-developed novichok nerve agent. Both survived.\n\nThe elder Skripal was convicted in 2006 of being a double-agent for the British. He was released from prison in 2010 under a spy swap deal and settled in England.\n\nBritain accused the Kremlin of having a hand in the attack and convinced its allies, including the U.S., to expel Russian diplomats and suspected spies in response. The mass expulsion saw hundreds of Russian officials expelled from 28 countries. Russia responded in kind.\n\nRussia is also accused of meddling in other countries\u2019 elections, including the 2016 U.S. presidential election, through the leaking of stolen emails and the use of social media to stir up divisions, though it denies any interference.\n\nAnd Putin recently unveiled a new generation of weapons of mass destruction in Russia\u2019s powerful arsenal, including the \u201cSatan 2\u201d hypersonic intercontinental ballistic missile, which he boasted is capable of defying air defenses and delivering its catastrophic nuclear payload anywhere in the U.S.\n\n\"As for Russia, it will continue to consistently be committed to strengthening global and regional security and stability and fully comply with its international obligations, build constructive cooperation with partners based on respect relying on international legal norms and the UN Charter,\" Putin told his ambassadors, according to TASS.",

        "article.text": "Vital evidence disappeared from police custody during their investigation into the death of Russian whistleblower Alexander Perepilichnyy, a court has heard.\n\nWhen Perepilichnyy died, authorities scoured his computer and discovered that he had been receiving threats. They also found a bank statement showing a mysterious payment worth half a billion dollars from an unknown company called \u201cPrecious Metal\u201d. But that and much of the other evidence from a forensic imaging of his computer \u201cwent missing\u201d from both police evidence disks and a server run by regional counterterrorism authorities, the head of Surrey police, Ian Pollard, testified at a coroner\u2019s inquest on Friday.\n\nThe revelation raises further questions about how UK authorities have handled the 2012 death of Perepilichnyy, who collapsed while jogging near his home in Surrey. This is the second time that police have admitted to losing key evidence \u2014 a toxicologist also threw away most of Perepilichnyy's stomach contents, limiting the ability of scientists to figure out whether or not he had been poisoned.\n\nPolice also failed to interview Perepilichnyy\u2019s secret lover, who dined with him on his final night alive, until BuzzFeed News tracked her down last year, and repeatedly stonewalled French detectives as they investigated his mysterious trip to Paris right before he died.\n\nPolice have long insisted Perepilichnyy died of natural causes, and the Home Office has invoked national security powers to withhold evidence from the inquest. But last summer, BuzzFeed News revealed that the British government was suppressing explosive intelligence provided by US spy agencies indicating that Perepilichnyy was assassinated on the orders of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Coroner Nicholas Hilliard QC told today\u2019s hearing that he had made \u201cenquiries\u201d about that intelligence, but did not give further details.\n\nPollard admitted in court today that if his police force had been aware of everything that is now known about Perepilichnyy \u201cfrom the get-go,\u201d then they would \u201chave suspicions\u201d about his death and would have conducted further investigation.\n\nThe government is now reviewing Perepilichnyy\u2019s death and 13 other suspected assassinations exposed by BuzzFeed News that authorities had previously ignored. Hilliard told the court that he had learned from the Home Office that the review will conclude by the end of April \u2014 around six weeks after it was originally announced.\n\nThe police investigation into Perepilichnyy\u2019s death has come under further scrutiny during the coroner\u2019s inquest this week. Elmira Medynska, the secret lover called to testify at the inquest only after BuzzFeed News tracked her down, told the court on Wednesday that Perepilichnyy was \u201cvery stressed\u201d as they dined together on the night before his death and that he demanded that he sit facing the restaurant\u2019s customers. He ate something \u201cbad\u201d and then spent an hour vomiting back at the hotel, she testified.\n\nAn independent expert from Kew Gardens told an earlier hearing of Perepilichnyy\u2019s inquest that she had found a substance with the same atomic weight as the plant toxin gelsemium in the dead man\u2019s stomach. However, the same expert told the inquest on Tuesday that further tests could not definitively identify that substance as gelsemium or any other plant toxin, and its origins could not be identified after the police toxicologist threw away most of the contents of Perepilichnyy\u2019s stomach.\n\nA number of different scientists have testified at the inquiry that they could not identify any sign of poison in any of the tests they ran on Perepilichnyy\u2019s available remains. One pathologist testified that, almost six years after his death and with his stomach contents thrown away, the tests they were able to run were \u201cvery detailed\u201d but \u201cnot exhaustive\u201d.\n\nIt was too late for scientists to test for nerve agents, long known to be in the Kremlin\u2019s arsenal but now under close scrutiny after the March poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal. However, a toxicologist testified that based on Perepilichnyy\u2019s symptoms, it was \u201cpossible but unlikely\u201d that he had been poisoned with a nerve agent.\n\nPollard, the head of Surrey Police, discovered that the computer material had disappeared last June, after the evidence was requested for the inquest, he testified on Friday. Police had been given two disks supposedly containing forensic imaging of Perepilichnyy\u2019s laptop, but they realised those images were not on the disks.\n\nPollard then learned that the material had been on a server belonging to the South East Counter Terrorism Unit, the government\u2019s regional counterterrorism authority. But when he accessed the server, the evidence was no longer there, either, due to \u201csystem failures\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately, they didn\u2019t back that up,\u201d Pollard said.\n\nThe material has never been recovered. It had included the bank statement containing the mysterious half-billion-dollar payment from an unknown company, Precious Metal. The payment was made in May 2011, around the same time that Perepilichnyy had been trying to reach a deal with Swiss prosecutors as he provided them with evidence of a massive Kremlin-linked fraud.\n\nIn other testimony, a Russian translator working for the police who examined Perepilichnyy\u2019s computer said she found threatening Skype messages warning him he faced prison and telling him if he wanted a \u201csafe, free life\u201d he would need to pay 300,000 rubles (around \u00a36,000 at the time) the next day.\n\nAs she examined the computer, the translator, Ekaterina Clarke-O\u2019Connell, remembered seeing huge amounts of money flowing through his bank accounts. She told the court she had the impression that something was \u201cnot right\u201d in Perepilchnyy\u2019s life.\n\nThe inquest has now finished hearing oral testimony. The coroner, Nicholas Hilliard QC, is expected to give his opinion by the end of May.",

        "article.text": "Russia's ambassador to Lebanon has said any US missiles fired at Syria would be shot down and the launch sites targeted, a step which could trigger a major escalation in the Syrian war.\n\nAlexander Zasypkin, in comments broadcast on Tuesday evening, said he was referring to a statement by Russian president Vladimir Putin and the Russian chief-of-staff.\n\n\"If there is a strike by the Americans then... the missiles will be downed and even the sources from which the missiles were fired,\" he told Hezbollah's al-Manar TV.\n\nDonald Trump: 'nothing is off the table' for US response to alleged Syria chemical attack\n\nThe Russian military said on 13 March it would respond to any US strike on Syria, targeting any missiles and launchers involved in such an attack.\n\nMr Zasypkin added that a clash \"should be ruled out and therefore we are ready to hold negotiations\".\n\nMoscow and Damascus deny the Syrian government was behind a suspected chemical weapons attack that has led to Donald Trump and Western allies considering military action against Bashar al-Assad's regime.\n\nBut the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday around 500 people were treated for \"signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals\" following the attack on a rebel enclave near Damascus at the weekend.\n\n:: In other developments ::\n\nTrump tweets Russia should 'get ready' for US attack'\n\nGorbachev makes rare intervention over 'enormous sense of alarm'\n\nCommercial flights in region face widespread disruption\n\nThe WHO said more than 70 people sheltering from bombardment in basements in the former rebel-heald pocket of eastern Ghouta were reported to have died. Of those, 43 were \"related to symptoms consistent with exposure to highly toxic chemicals,\" citing reports from its local health partners.\n\nResponding to Mr Zasypkin's comments, General Sir Richard Barrons, who led the UK\u2019s Joint Forces Command from 2013 to 2016, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI hope the ambassador has chosen his words very carefully because what he\u2019s actually saying is that if the US and allies decide to strike against Syrian chemical weapons and delivery aircraft, not only are they going to try and shoot down the missiles in flight - which they're capable of doing, but won't be with total success - but by saying the words 'launch platforms', he\u2019s saying they are going to try and sink ships, sink submarines and shoot aircraft out of the sky - that\u2019s war.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Moscow attempted to dial down the rhetoric, saying it hoped all sides involved in Syria would avoid doing anything that could destabilise an already fragile situation in the Middle East.\n\nIt maintained allegations that Syrian government forces had carried out a chemical weapons attack were not based on real facts and said it wanted an impartial investigation into the incident.\n\nAsked about Mr Zasypkin's comments, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said he did not want to comment on such matters.\n\n\"As before, we would like to hope that all sides will avoid any steps that a) are not provoked by anything and b) could significantly destabilise an already fragile situation in the region,\"\u0080\u009d he told reporters.\n\nThe prospect of military action against Mr Assad's government prompted European airspace authorities to warn planes to be careful when flying close to Syria.\n\nThe Eurocontrol airspace organisation said the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) had sent a \"Rapid Alert Notification\" that flight operations covering Cyprus and the surrounding skies needed to consider the possibility of air or missile strikes into Syria.\n\nAttack alert: air traffic in the Nicosia Flight Information Region ( FlightRadar24 )\n\nIn a notice posted to Eurocontrol's website, EASA said: \"Due to the possible launch of air strikes into Syria with air-to-ground and/or cruise missiles within the next 72 hours, and the possibility of intermittent disruption of radio navigation equipment, due consideration needs to be taken.\"\n\nMore than 20 flights are due to take off from the UK to Cyprus on Wednesday, including ones provided by British Airways, easyJet and Ryanair.\n\nOn Tuesday, Russia and the US blocked each other's attempts in the UN Security Council to set up international investigations into suspected chemical weapons attacks in Syria.\n\nEach country placed a resolution before the security council to vote on. The US text was vetoed by Russia, while the Russian text was not adopted because it did not gain enough votes.\n\nEastern Ghouta bombings: Syrian war in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14 show all Eastern Ghouta bombings: Syrian war in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/14 A Syrian woman and children run for cover amid the rubble of buildings.

EPA\n\nThe US resolution had proposed an independent mechanism for investigating the 7 April attack in the town of Douma, eastern Ghouta. It also called for an \u201cattribution\u201d clause that would identify the perpetrator of the attack.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, proposed that the UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres choose the investigators, but that the results be reviewed by Russia for \u201cacceptance\u201d prior to making them public, according to US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. It also lacked any clause to assign attribution of the suspected attack.\n\n\"History will record that, on this day, Russia chose protecting a monster over the lives of the Syrian people,\" Ms Haley said, referring to Mr Assad.\n\nShe said the US \"went the extra mile\" to get Russian support for the resolution to ensure that a new investigative body would be impartial, independent and professional - provisions she said were not in the rival Russian resolution.\n\nVassily Nebenzia, Russian ambassador to the UN, accused the US of trying to mislead the international community, and said it was \"taking one more step towards confrontation\".\n\nHe said the US and its allies did not need a resolution to determine responsibility because it was already blaming Syria and Russia.\n\n\"You do not want to hear the fact that no traces of a chemical attack were found in Douma,\" Mr Nebenzia said. \"You simply have been looking for a pretext\" and want the resolution to fail \"to justify the use of force against Syria\".\n\nThe diplomatic clash came after Syria invited a mission from the international chemical weapons watchdog to investigate the suspected poison gas attack.\n\nIts foreign ministry said it would help the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in a fact-finding mission into the alleged attack, which opposition activists say killed 40 people.\n\nThe White House announced on Tuesday Donald Trump would skip an upcoming summit in South America and instead remain in the US to \"oversee the American response to Syria and to monitor developments around the world\u201d.\n\nSyria civil war: Footage shows children treated following chemical weapons attack in Douma\n\nThe US president promised to respond \"forcefully\" to the alleged chemical attack, and that the US had \"a lot of options militarily\".\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let atrocities like we all witnessed... we can\u2019t let that happen in our world... especially when we\u2019re able to because of the power of the United States, the power of our country, we\u2019re able to stop it,\u201d he said.\n\nTheresa May joined Mr Trump in calling for a response to the Syrian regime's latest use of chemical weapons, \"if confirmed\".\n\nIn separate phone calls, Ms May, Mr Trump and French president Emmanuel Macron agreed the international community should work together to hold Mr Assad's government and its backers to account.\n\nOf the calls, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \u201cThey agreed that reports of a chemical weapons attack in Syria were utterly reprehensible and, if confirmed, represented further evidence of the Assad regime\u2019s appalling cruelty against its own people and total disregard for its legal obligations not to use these weapons.\n\n\u201cThey agreed that the international community needed to respond to uphold the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons. They agreed they would continue working closely together and with international partners to ensure that those responsible were held to account.\u201d\n\nDozens of buses carrying hundreds of rebel fighters, along with family members and civilians who did not wish to come back under Assad\u2019s rule, left Douma for opposition areas near Aleppo on Tuesday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.\n\nThe deal restores Mr Assad\u2019s control over the whole of eastern Ghouta \u2013 formerly the biggest rebel bastion near Damascus.\n\nAs part of the surrender deal, the Jaish al-Islam group that controlled the town released scores of people it had been holding.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies",

        "article.text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's morning declaration that \"nice and new and 'smart'\" missiles would soon be fired toward Syria caught most of his aides off guard and came before an agreement had been reached between key US allies, multiple American and Western officials said on Wednesday.\n\nThat Trump would surprise staffers and allies with a morning tweet is not new; he regularly sets his own tone for the day on Twitter based on cable television and his own mood. But Wednesday's messages were unique in their telegraphing of upcoming US military action, something Trump vowed he would never do as president\n\nA final decision on how to respond to the weekend's chemical attack in Syria had not yet been made when Trump issued his tweet, the White House said later on Wednesday.\n\n\"We're maintaining that we have a number of options and all those options are still on the table. Final decisions haven't been made yet,\" press secretary Sarah Sanders said. \"The President has a number of options at his disposal and all of those options remain on the table.\"\n\nTop military officials were at the White House on Wednesday afternoon to discuss options for Syria, according to senior aides. Defense Secretary James Mattis and Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were seen entering the White House shortly after 1 p.m. ET and departing roughly two hours later.\n\nSanders said Vice President Mike Pence had chaired a meeting of the National Security Council to discuss Syria. But those talks came after Trump indicated on Twitter that missile strikes were in the works.\n\nRussia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and \"smart!\" You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2018\n\nOur relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2018\n\n\"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia, because they will be coming,\" Trump wrote early Wednesday. \"You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!\"\n\nWhile Trump did not specify when a missile strike might come or where it could target, the message made clear he plans retaliatory action soon for the suspected chemical gas attack that killed at least 40 people.\n\nSanders indicated to reporters that missile strikes were not his only option.\n\n\"That's certainly one option, but that doesn't mean it's the only option or the only thing that the President may or may not do,\" she said.\n\nThe President's message raised the ire of at least one influential Republican, Senate Foreign Relations chairman Bob Corker, who said on Wednesday he believes action should come soon.\n\n\"The only thing I worry about is that it's not going to happen,\" Corker said on Capitol Hill. \"Now we're announcing what we're going to do and unfortunately it puts us in a place where possibly it creates a greater conflict.\"\n\nTrump remains engaged in intensive consultations with US partners, principally French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May, on a coordinated response to the attack. But those leaders have yet to reach firm agreement on the scale or timing of a response, the officials said, and it's possible that strikes don't begin until the end of the week.\n\nTrump has pressed his foreign counterparts and his aides to develop options that go further than strikes he ordered last year on a Syrian airfield in response to another chemical weapons attack. Those strikes did little to dampen the Syrian regime's abilities to carry out these type of attacks, and reports at the time indicated planes were taking off from the airstrip soon after the US strikes ended.\n\nThis time, Trump has pressed for a more muscular response that would more credibly deter Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad from carrying out chemical attacks on civilians in the future, officials said. But questions remain about how much bigger the response this time may be, and how willing US partners are to join in.\n\nCoalition\n\nUS officials had suggested that parliamentary approval in the UK could hamper May's ability to join in a coordinated effort in a significant way, though on Wednesday May sounded firmer in her determination to join allies in responding to the attack. She has not said whether she will seek approval from MPs before approving any action, and Trump has pressed his counterparts that urgent steps are necessary, according to people familiar with the conversations.\n\nEarlier this week, US officials said that a lack of firm evidence had led to concerns from May about launching strikes too early. But speaking in Birmingham on Wednesday, May said \"all the indications\" are that the Syrian regime was responsible for a chemical weapons attack in Douma, adding that the use of such weapons \"cannot go unchallenged.\"\n\nFrance also appears poised to play a leading role. Macron would not require parliamentary approval to launch strikes and he has described chemical weapons use as a red line that must be upheld.\n\nWhile Trump has made clear he believes the Syrian regime is responsible for the attack, observers have struggled to gain access to the scene and neither the US nor its allies have been able to provide firm evidence of culpability.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday, Sanders nevertheless pinned the blame on Syria and its backers in Moscow.\n\n\"The President holds Syria and Russia responsible for this chemical weapons attack,\" she said.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Mattis told reporters the US was \"still assessing the intelligence\" on whether the Assad regime is to blame for the attack.\n\n\"We stand ready to provide military options if they are appropriate as the President determined,\" Mattis said.\n\nResponding to Trump's Tweet, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Facebook that a missile strike could destroy evidence on the ground, interrupting the work of international investigators.\n\n\"Smart missiles should fly toward terrorists, not the legal government that has been fighting international terrorism for several years on its territory,\" Zakharova wrote.\n\nRussia has blamed Syrian opposition forced for the alleged chemical attack. In subsequent tweets on Wednesday, Trump bemoaned the poor state of relations between Washington and Moscow, something he's vowed to fix as president.\n\nThose efforts, he wrote, have been hindered by the special counsel's investigation into Russian election meddling.\n\nMuch of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 11, 2018\n\n\"Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama,\" he wrote.\n\nRussia\n\nEven as the Syria discussions are proceeding at the White House, Trump has remained preoccupied with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe. Most recently his anger has reached new heights after the FBI raided the office and hotel room of his private attorney Michael Cohen.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump canceled a planned trip to South America to monitor the response in Syria. The trip was supposed to have started on Friday, though the White House declined to say whether that timing indicated a strike was more likely at the end of the week.\n\nA Pentagon spokesman referred all inquiries on Trump's tweet warning Russia to \"get ready\" because missiles \"will be coming\" to the White House.\n\n\"The department does not comment on potential future military actions,\" Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Michael Andrews said in a statement.\n\nThat echoes what Trump has long maintained would be his own posture as President and a stance he angrily chided then-President Barack Obama for violating in 2013.\n\nWhy do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria. Why can't we just be quiet and, if we attack at all, catch them by surprise? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 29, 2013\n\n\"Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria,\" he wrote then. \"Why can't we just be quiet and, if we attack at all, catch them by surprise?\"\n\n\"In war, the elememt (sic) of surprise is sooooo important.What the hell is Obama doing,\" he added later.\n\nIt's the second time in recent weeks that Trump has appeared to signal his intentions in Syria ahead of time. He announced during an event in Ohio that US troops would soon return from the country, where they are helping to battle Islamic State.\n\nAnd while he did not set a timeline for the withdrawal, he's told his top military advisers he wants the ISIS battle to conclude within six months and American servicemen to return.",

        "article.text": "The graphic video shows a blonde woman and a black man having sex through a mock hidden camera in what appears to be a hotel room. Rubinjer was the only user to post the video, and the account pushed the content on several platforms, both as animated GIFs and full videos, before the 2016 election.\n\nReddit is the fourth-most-visited website in the United States, according to the web analytics company Alexa. It is home to one of the largest and most popular Donald Trump fan communities on the web, r/The_Donald, where Trump once gave a Q-and-A during his presidential campaign. The Rubinjer account posted the porn video to that same community in 2016.\n\nIn an announcement to its users on Tuesday, Reddit said that 944 accounts \u2014 including Rubinjer \u2014 were banned for \u201csuspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin.\u201d The company had not previously identified any of the accounts, 71 of which had over 1,000 lifetime \u201cupvotes\u201d on the site.\n\nSince last September, the Internet Research Agency had thousands of accounts deleted from Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr, where they pushed divisive messages while posing as Americans. Reddit said it purged suspected accounts as far back as 2015.\n\nRubinjer, which posted the hoax porn video, last posted on May 18, 2017.\n\nAttempts to push the porn video largely fell flat, with most users expressing skepticism.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s her I think we'd see her face at least once,\u201d wrote one user on the Reddit community r/Rule34.\n\nThe troll farm account mostly posted relatable memes on Imgur to gain trust with users. Its top post, titled \u201cEating at a Waffle House full of cops,\u201d received over 1,900 upvotes.\n\nIts second top post, posted to the subreddit r/BlackPeopleGifs, is a clip taken from the episode of Saturday Night Live immediately after the 2016 election, in which Dave Chappelle expresses mock incredulity at a character who says that \u201cAmerica is racist.\u201d\n\nFour of Rubinjer\u2019s other top ten posts mock Hillary Clinton on the pro-Trump community r/The_Donald. Many of Rubinjer\u2019s posts remain live on Reddit, although his profile page is inaccessible.\n\nRubinjer also used Reddit to promote an anti-Hillary Clinton video game, titled Hilltendo, before the 2016 election. Hilltendo\u2019s origins as an Internet Research Agency production were first discovered by CNN last month.\n\nIdentifying Russian disinformation became a hobby for many users on Reddit, who believed state-sponsored trolls were plaguing the platform.\n\nOne Reddit user, Josh Russell, posted a large cache of suspected IRA-linked accounts to a Reddit thread over the last two months. Russell\u2019s list, which he posted to the community r/Active_Measures, closely mirrored the one Reddit released on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty easy to find the accounts,\u201d said Russell, a systems engineer in Indiana who goes by Eye_Josh on Reddit. \u201cI just checked for accounts posting links to known Russian (Internet Research Agency) websites. I mean, not a whole lot of people would know about an anti-Clinton Flash game other than (troll farm employees).\u201d\n\nReddit largely remained silent on Russian propaganda\u2019s infiltration into its platform until an advertisement for the contents of a data leak from the Internet Research Agency, first reported by The Daily Beast, appeared on a Russian auction website. The listing for the data leak promised \u201cAmerican proxies\u201d to use the service.\n\nDays after the report, Reddit\u2019s CEO Steve Huffman promised it was doing \u201cour best to identify and remove\u201d state-sponsored disinformation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Huffman informed Reddit users their process in identifying Russian propaganda accounts in an announcement post.\n\n\u201cThere were a number of signals: suspicious creation patterns, usage patterns (account sharing), voting collaboration, etc,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also corroborated our findings with public lists from other companies (e.g. Twitter.)\u201c\n\nSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, applauded Reddit\u2019s release of suspected disinformation accounts in a statement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that the Kremlin will use any means at its disposal to spread propaganda and misinformation, and we each bear some responsibility for exercising good judgment and a healthy amount of skepticism when it comes to the things we read and spread on social media,\u201d Warner said.\n\nPornhub did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFormer FBI agent Clint Watts, who testified before Congress in 2017 about Russian disinformation tacticts, told NBC News that a pivotal part of Russia\u2019s propaganda strategy is to \u201cplace videos like this on 4chan or Reddit and hope it takes off in other places on its own.\u201d\n\n\u201cReddit and other anonymous platforms, we\u2019ve always believed, were perfect hosting platforms for forgeries,\u201d Watts said.\n\nWatts then pointed to embroiled data firm Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, whose CEO claimed in hidden camera footage that the company could use Ukrainian sex workers to entrap politicians.\n\nCambridge Analytica suspended Nix from the company after the video was made public.\n\n\u201cMr. Nix\u2019s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation,\" Cambridge Analytica wrote in a statement on its website.\n\nWatts noted that the problem of fake videos is just beginning to gain attention.\n\n\u201cCambridge Analytica talked about setting up Ukrainian prostitutes and putting it out in the media to discredit people. It\u2019s all using the same technique,\u201d said Watts. \u201cThis one, it sounds like, was terrible, but it shows the intent to get there. As we see fake audio and video online become more authentic looking, instead of 250,000 views, maybe next time you get 250 million.\u201d",

        "article.text": "\u00a9 Daily Mail The giant nuclear powered USS Harry S Truman, carrying 90 aircraft and escorted by its five-strong strike group of destroyers and cruisers, is powering towards Europe and the Middle East A huge task force of 12 warships is setting sail for Syria in one of the biggest concentrations of US naval power since the 2003 Iraq invasion, it has emerged.\n\n\n\nThe giant nuclear powered USS Harry S Truman, carrying 90 aircraft and escorted by its five-strong strike group of destr oy ers and cruisers, is powering towards Europe and the Middle East.\n\nA further four destroyers are believed to be in or near the Mediterranean already, including the Donald Cook, Porter, Carney and Laboon along with two nuclear-powered submarines, Georgia and John Warner.\n\n\n\nIt comes amid heightened tensions as Donald Trump continues to consider launching airstrikes on Syria in retaliation for a chemical gas attack in a rebel-held town on Saturday.\n\nSyrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has reportedly moved his military assets to Russian bases in the country in the hope that the US and its allies would be reluctant to launch strikes anywhere near Vladimir Putin's forces. \u00a9 Provided by Associated Newspapers Limited The Arleigh Burke-class destroyer USS Farragut (pictured) is among the ships accompanying the giant aircraft carrier The USS Harry S Truman and its support ships were due to leave Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIt is accompanied by the cruiser USS Normandy and destroyers USS Farragut, USS Forrest Sherman, USS Bulkeley and USS Arleigh Burke.\n\nAlso among the strike group's ships is the German frigate FGS Hessen, a state-of-the-art vessel specialising in air defense.\n\nUS Navy officials said the Hessen is the only type of ship in the Western world with three kinds of surface-to-air missiles. Its radar has a detection range of more than 200 nautical miles for air targets.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Newspapers Limited USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier\n\nNimitz-class\n\nWeight: 116,000 tons Length: 1,092 ft Propulsion: Two Westinghouse A4W nuclear reactors and four steam turbines Propellers: Four Speed: 35mph Range: Unlimited Ship's crew: 3,200 Air wing personnel: 2,480ft Aircraft carried: 90 fixed wing and helicopters Armament: Sea Sparrow, RIM-116 Missile and three Phalanx guns Strikes group: USS Normandy, USS Bulkeley, USS Arleigh Burke, USS Forrest Sherman, USS Farragut\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Newspapers Limited The USS Georgia, an Ohio-class submarine carrying guided missiles, is also said to be in the area Already in position is the USS Donald Cook, an American destroyer equipped with up to 60 Tomahawk land attack missiles.\n\nIn April last year Trump ordered 59 Tomahawk strikes on the Shayrat Airbase in response to a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held Khan Sheikhun.\n\nThese strikes were launched from two US warships stationed in the Mediterranean.\n\nTrump and his national security aides on Thursday discussed US options on Syria, where he has threatened missile strikes in response to a poison gas attack, as a Russian envoy voiced fears of wider conflict between Washington and Moscow.\n\n\n\nWorries about a confrontation between Russia, Syria's big ally , and the West have been running high since Trump said on Wednesday that missiles 'will be coming' in response to the attack in the Syrian town of Douma on April 7, and lambasted Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Newspapers Limited The 500ft USS Laboon destroyer (pictured), also armed is reported to be among US warships already deployed in the area. It is shown launching a Tomahawk cruise missile in an attack on southern Iraq in 1996 Trump tempered those remarks on Thursday and even as he consulted allies such and Britain and France, who could join in any US-led strikes on Syria, there were signs of efforts to prevent the crisis from spiraling out of control.\n\n'Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!' Trump wrote on Twitter, raising the prospect that an attack might not be as imminent as he seemed to suggest the day before.\n\n\n\nTrump met his national security team on the situation in Syria later in the day and 'no final decision has been made,' the White House said in a statement.\n\n'We are continuing to assess intelligence and are engaged in conversations with our partners and allies,' it said.\n\nThat did not necessarily signal, however, that Trump was cooling to the idea of military action, especially given the high stakes in Syria. U.S. officials noted that Washington was still assessing intelligence and coordinating allies.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Newspapers Limited The guided-missile cruiser USS Normandy (pictured) is also steaming towards Europe and the Middle East Trump spoke to British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday and the two leaders talked about the 'need for a joint response to Syria's use of chemical weapons,' the White House said.\n\n\n\nMay's office said they agreed on the need to deter Assad's government from further such attacks.\n\n\n\nTrump was also due to speak with French President Emmanuel Macron, who said France had proof the Syrian government carried out the attack near Damascus, which aid groups have said killed dozens of people, and will decide whether to strike back when all the necessary information has been gathered.\n\n\n\n'We have proof that last week ... chemical weapons were used, at least with chlorine, and that they were used by the regime of Bashar al-Assad,' Macron said, without offering details of any evidence.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Newspapers Limited Also in or near the Mediterranean is the USS Porter, pictured here launching a Tomahawk land attack missile in 2003 Two US officials familiar with an investigation of samples from Douma and the symptoms of victims said initial indications that a mix of weaponised chlorine gas and sarin were used in the attack appeared to be correct. But US intelligence agencies have not completed their assessment or reached a final conclusion, the officials said.\n\n\n\nRussia, Syria and its other main backer, Iran, have said reports of the Douma attack were fabricated by rebels and rescue workers and have accused the United States of seeking to use it as a pretext to attack the Syrian government.\n\nRussia said it deployed military police in Douma on Thursday after the town was taken over by government forces.\n\n'They are the guarantors of law and order in the town,' RIA news agency quoted Russia's defense ministry as saying.\n\nThere were signs of a global effort to head off a direct confrontation between Russia and the West. The Kremlin said a crisis communications link with the United States, created to avoid an accidental clash over Syria, was in use.\n\nAmerica's USS Georgia submarine\n\n\n\nOhio-class submarine Length: 560 ft Propulsion: One S8G PWR nuclear reactor, two geared turbines, an auxiliary motor and a shaft at 60,000 shp Speed: 29mph Test depth: Greater than 800ft Crew: 155 Armament: Four torpedo tubes and 154 BGM-109 Tomahawks in 22 groups of seven\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Newspapers Limited The U.S. has maintained its threat of rocket attacks in response to Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad's sickening chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Douma on Saturday Vassily Nebenzia, Moscow's ambassador to the United Nations, said he ' cannot exclude' war between the United States and Russia and urged Washington and its allies to refrain from military action against Syria.\n\n\n\n'The immediate priority is to avert the danger of war,' he told reporters. 'We hope there will be no point of no return,' the envoy said.\n\nA team of experts from the global chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, was traveling to Syria and will start its investigations on Saturday, the Netherlands-based agency said.\n\nIt was not clear whether Trump and U.S. allies would wait for the results of the investigation before deciding on a strike.\n\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told Congress he believed there was a chemical attack in Syria, but added a short while later that the United States had not made any decision to launch military action. He also suggested he was examining ways to prevent any strikes from triggering a broader conflict.\n\n'I don't want to talk about a specific attack that is not yet in the offing ... This would be pre-decisional,' Mattis told the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee.\n\n\u00a9 Provided by Associated Newspapers Limited Family members look on as the U.S. Navy aircraft carrier USS Harry S.

        "article.text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France concluded after technical analysis of open sources and \u201creliable intelligence\u201d that a chemical attack on Douma on April 7 was carried out by Syrian government forces, a declassified intelligence report showed on Saturday.\n\nHere is the full declassified national assessment provided by the French foreign ministry in English:\n\nI. SEVERAL LETHAL CHEMICAL ATTACKS TOOK PLACE IN THE TOWN OF DOUMA IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OF SATURDAY,7 APRIL 2018, AND WE ASSESS WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT THEY WERE CARRIED OUT BY THE SYRIAN REGIME.\n\nFollowing the Syrian regime\u2019s resumption of its military offensive, as well as high levels of air force activity over the town of Douma in Eastern Ghouta, two new cases of toxic agents employment were spontaneously reported by civil society and local and international media from the late afternoon of 7 April.\n\nNon-governmental medical organizations active in Ghouta (the Syrian American Medical Society and the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations), whose information is generally reliable, publicly stated that strikes had targeted in particular local medical infrastructure on 6 and 7 April.\n\nA massive influx of patients in health centers in Eastern Ghouta (at the very least 100 people) presenting symptoms consistent with exposure to a chemical agent was observed and documented during the early evening. In total, several dozen people, more than forty according to several sources, are thought to have died from exposure to a chemical substance.\n\nThe information collected by France forms a body of evidence that is sufficient to attribute responsibility for the chemical attacks of 7 April to the Syrian regime.\n\n1. \u2013 Several chemical attacks took place at Douma on 7 April 2018.\n\nThe French services analyzed the testimonies, photos and videos that spontaneously appeared on specialized websites, in the press and on social media in the hours and days following the attack.\n\nTestimonies obtained by the French services were also analyzed. After examining the videos and images of victims published online, they were able to conclude with a high degree of confidence that the vast majority are recent and not fabricated. The spontaneous circulation of these images across all social networks confirms that they were not video montages or recycled images. Lastly, some of the entities that published this information are generally considered reliable.\n\nFrench experts analyzed the symptoms identifiable in the images and videos that were made public. These images and videos were taken either in enclosed areas in a building where around 15 people died, or in local hospitals that received contaminated patients. These symptoms can be described as follows:\n\n- Suffocation, asphyxia or breathing difficulties,\n\n- Mentions of a strong chlorine odor and presence of green smoke in affected areas,\n\n- Hypersalivation and hypersecretions (particularly oral and nasal),\n\n- Cyanosis,\n\n- Skin burns and corneal burns.\n\nNo deaths from mechanical injuries were visible. All of these symptoms are characteristic of a chemical weapons attack, particularly choking agents and organophosphorus agents or hydrocyanic acid. Furthermore, the apparent use of bronchodilators by the medical services observed in videos reinforces the hypothesis of intoxication by choking agents.\n\n2. \u2013 Given in particular ongoing military operations in Eastern Ghouta around 7 April, we assess witha high degree of confidence that the Syrian regime holds responsibility.\n\nReliable intelligence indicates that Syrian military officials have coordinated what appears to be the use of chemical weapons containing chlorine on Douma, on April 7.\n\nThe attack of 7 April 2018 took place as part of a wider military offensive carried out by the regime on the Eastern Ghouta region. Launched in February 2018, this offensive has now enabled Damascus to regain control of the entire enclave.\n\nAs a reminder, the Russian military forces active in Syria enable the regime to enjoy unquestionable air superiority, giving it the total military freedom of action it needs for its indiscriminate offensives on urban areas.\n\nThe tactic adopted by pro-regime forces involved separating the various groups (Ahrar al-Sham, Faylaq al-Rahman, and Jaysh al-Islam) in order to focus their efforts and obtain negotiated surrender agreements. The three main armed groups therefore began separate negotiations with the regime and Russia. The first two groups (Ahrar al-Sham and Faylaq al-Rahman) concluded agreements that resulted in the evacuation of nearly 15,000 fighters and their families.\n\nDuring this first phase, the Syrian regime\u2019s political and military strategy consisted in alternating indiscriminate military offensives against local populations, which sometimes included the use of chlorine, and pauses in operations for negotiations.\n\nNegotiations with Jaysh al-Islam began in March but were not fully conclusive. On 4 April, part of the Jaysh al-Islam group (around one quarter of the group according to estimates) accepted the surrender agreement and fighters and their families were sent to Idlib (approximately 4,000 people, with families).\n\nHowever, between 4,500 and 5,500 Jaysh al-Islam fighters, mostly located in Douma, refused the terms of negotiation. As a result, from 6 April onwards, the Syrian regime, with support from Russian forces, resumed its intensive bombing of the area, ending a pause in ground and aerial operations that had been observed since negotiations began in mid-March. This was the context for the chemical strikes analyzed in this document.\n\nGiven this context, the Syrian regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons makes sense from both the military and strategic points of view:\n\nTactically speaking, this type of ammunition is used to flush out enemy fighters sheltering in homes and engage in urban combat in conditions that are more favorable to the regime. It accelerates victory and has a multiplier effect that helps speed up the capitulation of the last bastion of armed groups.\n\nStrategically speaking, chemical weapons and particularly chlorine, documented in Eastern Ghouta since early 2018, are especially used to punish civilian populations present in zones held by fighters opposed to the Syrian regime and to create a climate of terror and panic that encourages them to surrender.\n\nAs the war is not over for the regime, it uses these indiscriminate strikes to show that resistance is futile and pave the way for capturing these last pockets of armed resistance.\n\nSince 2012, the Syrian forces have repeatedly used the same pattern of military tactics: toxic chemicals are mainly used during wider urban offensives, as was the case in late 2016 during the recapture of Aleppo, where chlorine weapons were regularly used in conjunction with traditional weapons. The zones targeted, such as Eastern Ghouta, are all major military objectives for Damascus.\n\n3 - The French services have no information to support the theory whereby the armed groups in Ghouta would have sought to acquire or have possessed chemical weapons.\n\nThe French services also assess that a manipulation of the images circulated massively from Saturday, 7 April is not credible, in part because the groups present in Ghouta do not have the resources to carry out a communications operation on such a scale.\n\nII. SINCE APRIL 2017,THE SYRIAN REGIME HAS USED CHEMICAL WEAPONS AND TOXIC AGENTS IN ITS MILITARY OPERATIONS INCREASINGLY OFTEN.\n\n4. \u2013The Syrian regime has conserved a clandestine chemical weapons program since 2013.\n\nThe French services assess that Syria did not declare all of its stockpiles and capacities to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) during its late, half-hearted accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) in October 2013.\n\nSyria omitted, notably,to declare many of the activities of its Scientific Studies and Research Centre (SSRC). Only recently has it accepted to declare certain SSRC activities under the Chemical Weapons Convention(CWC), but not, however, all of them. Initially, it also failed to declare the sites at Barzeh and Jemraya, eventually doing so in 2018.\n\nThe French services assess that four questions asked of the Syrian regime by the OPCW and which have remained unanswered require particular attention, particularly in the context of these latest cases of the use of chemical weapons in Syria:\n\n- possible remaining stocks of yperite (mustard gas) and DF (a sarin precursor);\n\n- undeclared chemical weapons of small caliber which may have been used on several occasions, including during the attack on Khan Sheikhoun in April2017;\n\n- signs of the presence of VX and sarin on production and loading sites;\n\n- signs of the presence of chemical agents that have never been declared, including nitrogen mustard, lewisite, soman and VX.\n\nSince 2014, the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) has published several reports confirming the use of chemical weapons against civilians in Syria. The UN-OPCW Joint Investigation Mechanism(JIM) on chemical weapons attacks has investigated nine occasions when they have allegedly been used.\n\nIn its August and October 2016 reports, the JIM attributed three cases of the use of chlorine to the Damascus regime and one case of the use of yperite to Daesh, but none to any Syrian armed group.\n\n5. \u2013 A series of chemical attacks has taken place in Syria since 4 April 2017\n\nA French national assessment published on 26 April 2017 following the Khan Sheikhoun attack listed all the chemical attacks in Syria since 2012, along with the assessment of their probability according to French services.\n\nThis attack, carried out in two phases, at Latamneh on 30 March, and then at Khan Sheikhoun with sarin gas on 4 April,led to the death of more than 80 civilians.\n\nThe French authorities considered at the time that it was very likely that the Syrian armed and security forces held responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe French services have identified 44 allegations of the use of chemical weapons and toxic agents since 4 April 2017, the date of the sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun. Of these 44 allegations, the French services consider that the evidence collected around 11 of the attacks gave reason to assess they were of a chemical nature.\n\nChlorine is believed to have been used in most cases, while the services also believe a neurotoxic agent was used at Harasta on 18 November 2017.\n\nIn this context, a considerable rise in cases of use can be noted since the non-renewal of the mechanism of the UN-OPCW Joint Investigation Mechanism (JIM) in November 2017 because of Russia\u2019s veto at the UN Security Council. A considerable increase in chlorine attacks since the beginning of the offensive on Eastern Ghouta has also been clearly observed and proven.\n\nA series of attacks preceded the major attack of 7 April2018, as part of a wider offensive (at least 8 chlorine attacks in Douma, Shayfounia and Hamouria).\n\nThese facts need to be considered in the light of a chemical warfare modus operandi of the Syrian regime that has been well documented since the attacks on Eastern Ghouta on 21 August 2013 and on Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April 2017.\n\nAs part of a continuous increase in violence employed against civilians in enclaves refusing the regime\u2019s authority, and in violation of its international obligations despite clear warnings from UN Security Council and OPCW members, Damascus seeks to seize a tactical military advantage locally, and above all to terrorize populations in order to break down all remaining resistance. It can be noted that, since the attacks of\n\n7 April 2018, the group Jaysh al-Islam has negotiated its departure from Douma with the regime and Russia, demonstrating the success of this tactic.\n\nOn the basis of this overall assessment and on the intelligence collected by our services, and in the absence to date of chemical samples analyzed by our own laboratories, France therefore considers (i) that, beyond possible doubt, a chemical attack was carried out against civilians at Douma on 7 April 2018; and (ii) that there is no plausible scenario other than that of an attack by Syrian armed forces as part of a wider offensive in the Eastern Ghouta enclave.\n\nThe Syrian armed and security forces are also considered to be responsible for other actions in the region as part of this same offensive in 2017 and 2018. Russia has undeniably provided active military support to the operations to seize back Ghouta.\n\nIt has, moreover, provided constant political cover to the Syrian regime over the employment of chemical weapons, both at the UN Security Council and at the OPCW, despite conclusions to the contrary by the JIM.\n\nThis assessment will be updated as we collect new information.",

        "article.text": "Brazil\u2019s attorney general charged congressman Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right presidential candidate who had been running in second place in the polls, with inciting hatred and discrimination against blacks, indigenous communities, women and gays.\n\nThe case injected a new jolt of drama into Brazil\u2019s presidential election, which will be held in October. The charge came less than a week after the front-runner in the race, former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, began serving a 12-year sentence for corruption.\n\nThe charging document, which was signed by attorney general Raquel Dodge, includes a long list of incendiary remarks by Mr Bolsonaro, who has developed a strong and loyal following by using harsh language and vowing to adopt severe tactics to address Brazil\u2019s epidemic of violence.\n\nIf convicted, Mr Bolsonaro, 63, could face up to three years in prison and a $117,000 (\u00a382,000) fine.\n\nMs Dodge outlined several passages from a speech Mr Bolsonaro gave a year ago in Rio de Janeiro, alleging that they constituted \u201chate speech\u201d. Mr Bolsonaro lamented the state of quilombolas, traditional communities of Afro-Brazilians that enjoy legal protections.\n\nResidents of one quilombola he had visited recently \u201cdid nothing,\u201d Mr Bolsonaro said. He added: \u201cI think they don\u2019t even manage to procreate anymore.\u201d He also spoke dismissively about indigenous territories.\n\nIn another part of the speech, Mr Bolsonaro said he had four sons \u2013 and one daughter, who he said had been the result of a \u201cmoment of weakness\u201d.\n\nMs Dodge also noted several homophobic remarks, including an instance in which Mr Bolsonaro said he would \u201cprefer that my son die in an accident than show up with some dude with a moustache\u201d.\n\nMr Bolsonaro posted a television interview on his social media accounts in which he called allegations of racism baseless.\n\n\u201cFor the love of God, you can\u2019t say anything in this country,\u201d he said in the interview.\n\nMs Dodge also charged one of Mr Bolsonaro\u2019s sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, a fellow federal lawmaker and one of his father\u2019s most prominent surrogates, with threatening a journalist.\n\nWorld news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n51 show all World news in pictures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/51 16 April 2018 People participate in a protest against the rape of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua near Jammu, and a teenager in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh state, in Bangalore, India Reuters\n\n2/51 15 April 2018 Fireworks are set off as the final performance takes place during the Closing Ceremony for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

Later, reports said that the explosion was caused by an accident at the facility.\n\n\n\nThe Iranian base, located in the Jabal Azzan region south of Aleppo, is the largest in the country.\n\n\n\nHezbollah media sources denied the reports and said that the explosions at the site resulted from explosives detonating in a warehouse.\n\n\n\n\u201cA powerful explosion went off late Saturday in an area of southern Aleppo province,\u201d the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said.\n\n\n\nThe war monitor\u2019s head, Rami Abdel Rahman, said the area was known to host Iranian forces deployed in Syria to support President Bashar Assad\u2019s regime as well as allied Afghan fighters from the Fatemiyoun Brigade.\n\n\n\nSeven Iranian military personnel were killed last week in an air strike on a Syrian air base which was blamed on Israel.\n\n\n\nJerusalem did not confirm or deny mounting the raid, but Israeli officials said the Tiyas, or T-4, air base near Homs was being used by troops from Iran, and that Israel would not accept such a presence in Syria by its arch foe.\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Iran's entrenchment in Syria during a cabinet meeting on Sunday. Relying information from a phone call he held with his British counterpart Theresa May, Netanyahu said he: \"reiterated that the element that is undermining the Middle East more than any other is Iran, and that President Assad must understand that when he allows Iran and its proxies to establish its military presence in Syria, he is endangering Syria and the stability of the entire region.\"\n\nNetanyahu's remarks at the weekly cabinet meeting on the allied attack on Syria's chemical weapons, April 15, 2018 (GPO)Israel said in February it had intercepted an Iranian drone launched from Syria, and carried out air strikes against air defenses and Iranian targets in the country. Iran denied at the time the downing of its drone in Israel.",

        "article.text": "The National Archives of Japan has disclosed the names of 3,607 members of the Imperial Japanese Army\u2019s notorious Unit 731, which conducted germ warfare and other biological experiments mainly on prisoners in China before and during World War II, according to a researcher.\n\nKatsuo Nishiyama, professor emeritus of Shiga University of Medical Science and head of the group that requested the disclosure, told The Japan Times on Monday that \u201cit is the first time that almost all of the real names and addresses of the unit\u2019s members have been unveiled as a definitive and official document.\u201d\n\nThe history of secretive Unit 731 had long been concealed. Its commander, Lt. Gen. Shiro Ishii, and others received immunity from prosecution by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East after giving the United States its data on germ warfare.\n\nThe list, dated Jan. 1, 1945, includes names, ranks and personal information \u2014 such as addresses and family members \u2014 of 52 surgeons, 49 engineers, 38 nurses and 1,117 combat medics, mainly those attached to the headquarters of the unit, which was officially known as the Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department of the Kwantung Army.\n\nNishiyama announced the disclosure of the list at a news conference Saturday in Kyoto.\n\nThe unit, which was established in 1936 to develop biological weapons, conducted research mostly using Chinese and Koreans who had been arrested on espionage charges. The research included infecting prisoners with germs before performing live vivisections on them, and deliberately causing frostbite to observe the process of necrosis.\n\nA request to the national archives to disclose the list was first filed by a group led by Nishiyama in 2015. Initially, the released list was mostly blacked out. But almost all of the names and ranks of the members were declassified in January after negotiations. Personal information on some individuals remains secret.\n\nA group led by Nishiyama plans to urge Kyoto University to determine the legitimacy of a university degree conferred on one of the medical officers in the unit, arguing his dissertation may have been based on experiments performed on living people.\n\nThe group has been collecting signatures to back its request.\n\nUnit 731 was involved in research on more than 20 types of bacteria including anthrax, smallpox and botulinum. About 3,000 people worked at its headquarters in the suburbs of Harbin in what was then Manchuria. Historians believe that more than 3,000 people died in the human experiments.\n\nA U.S. Army report dated May 5, 1982, stated that the desire of various U.S. committees to keep the information on the experiments out of the public domain as well as the hands of the former Soviet Union, also factored into the decision not to prosecute Ishii.\n\nAlthough much of the information regarding the unit has been kept under wraps in the 70-plus years since the end of the war, Nishiyama said he hoped \u201cthe disclosure of the official documents will help in shedding more light on the unit and its history.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the social impact he hoped the disclosure would have, he replied that he \u201cpersonally believes that Unit 731 has a collective responsibility to account for its war crimes, and that those crimes must be atoned for as a way of showing that those crimes will never be repeated.\u201d\n\nThe citizens\u2019 group he leads is making a petition to have Kyoto University determine the legitimacy of a university degree conferred on a medical officer in the unit.\n\nTo support its case, the group\u2019s website draws on examples of suspected human experimentation that were disguised as experiments on monkeys. One example refers to a \u201cmonkey\u201d that \u201ccomplained of headache, fever, and lost appetite\u201d \u2014 circumstantial evidence that indicates the experiments were conducted on humans instead.\n\n\u201cKyoto University has not made independent efforts to verify or atone for its role in wartime research. We hope that our petition will precipitate further verification by Kyoto University to look into the legitimacy of the dissertation,\u201d Nishiyama added.The Kwantung Army was part of the Imperial Japanese Army and stationed in northeastern China, which was under Japanese control.",

By ending new oil and gas exploration in our waters, the fourth-largest exclusive economic zone on the planet is out of bounds for new fossil fuel exploitation. New Zealand has stood up to one of the most powerful industries in the world.\n\n\u201cBold global leadership on the greatest challenge of our time has never been more urgent and Ardern has stepped up to that climate challenge.\u201d\n\nThe opposition party slammed the government\u2019s ban as \u201ceconomic vandalism\u201d and said it made no environmental sense.\n\n\u201cThis decision will ensure the demise of an industry that provides over 8000 high-paying jobs and $2.5bn for the economy,\u201d National\u2019s energy and resources spokesman, Jonathan Young, said.\n\n\u201cThis decision is devoid of any rationale. It certainly has nothing to do with climate change. These changes will simply shift production elsewhere in the world, not reduce emissions.\u201d\n\n'The anti-Trump': New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern earns nickname from Vogue Read more\n\nBut the Forest & Bird conservation group said the ban was a \u201chuge step forward\u201d for the country and sent a message to the oil and gas industry that New Zealand waters were no longer \u201ctheir playground\u201d.\n\n\u201cHalf the world\u2019s whale and dolphin species visit or live in New Zealand waters, from the critically endangered Maui\u2019s dolphin to giant blue whales,\u201d said the group\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Hague.\n\n\u201cToday, these sensitive creatures are made safer from the threat of oil spills and the sonic barrage of seismic testing.

It was skewed right from the beginning.\n\n\u201cResidents were asked whether we agreed with pro-lifers not being allowed to say \u2018murderer\u2019.

So I\u2019m proud that we are doing it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m, personally, a practising Christian myself and so I think it\u2019s important to recognise that this is about protecting women from harassment and intimidation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been clear that that\u2019s what this was about. It wasn\u2019t a debate for or against abortion.\u201d\n\nThe British Pregnancy Advice Service called on the government to now introduce legislation \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d to create safe zones around all abortion clinics.\n\nSpokeswoman Katherine O\u2019Brien said: \u201cThe protests in Ealing are sadly not isolated incidents. On a daily basis, women across the country are being confronted by increasingly aggressive groups of protesters as they try to access safe, legal healthcare.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about the rights and wrongs of abortion \u2013 this is about the harassment of women. The government has a duty to provide all women with the same level of protection that will now be offered in Ealing.\u201d",

REUTERS/Radovan Stoklasa\n\nThe killing of Jan Kuciak, 27, who investigated corruption among politically-connected business people, and his fianc\u00e9e at their home in February increased widespread anger about persistent corruption allegations, leading to the largest near-weekly protests since the end of communism in 1989.\n\nAmid growing pressure last month, long-serving prime minister Robert Fico stepped down to save his three-party government, and picked his deputy, Peter Pellegrini, to lead a reshuffled cabinet.\n\nNews website Dennik N estimated that Sunday\u2019s protest drew around 30,000 in the capital Bratislava, about half the size of the biggest protests last month. Demonstrators want the police chief and the special prosecutor out and a crackdown on corruption.\n\nProtest organisers said those two offices \u201chave long overlooked corruption scandals reported by Jan Kuciak and other investigative journalists\u201d.\n\n\u201cSlovakia has to be a country where corruption, not courage, is punished,\u201d one of organisers Karolina Farska told the rally.\n\nIn office since 2004, special prosecutor Dusan Kovacik is responsible for prosecuting abuse of power and corruption among public servants and politicians. According to data from his office last year, he has overseen 61 cases between 2009-2017 and has not pressed criminal charges in any of them.\n\nPolice president Tibor Gaspar is also refusing to quit although the new interior minister is reviewing his work in his five years in the post.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man attends a protest rally in reaction to the murder of Slovak investigative reporter Jan Kuciak and his fiancee Martina Kusnirova, in Bratislava, Slovakia April 5, 2018.

About 48 percent of bribe cases dealt with by courts involved amounts of less than 100 euros.\n\n\u201cAll the scandals that went unpunished brought me here. So far only puppets in the government have changed but we haven\u2019t seen real change,\u201d protester Martin Mataseje, a 39-year old IT consultant, told Reuters.\n\nInterior Minister Tomas Drucker is yet to alter the leadership of the police but has agreed to change the law allowing him to name Gaspar\u2019s successor to ensure an impartial investigation of Kuciak\u2019s murder.\n\nPolice believe Kuciak\u2019s murder was related to his work. He reported on suspected tax fraud by people some of whom have links to the ruling Smer party.\n\nSome of his reporting was on deals between the government and the country\u2019s biggest privately-owned security firm, whose owner is related to Gaspar. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nKuciak was also investigating Italian businessmen in Slovakia with suspected mafia links, one of whom had had dealings with two people who later worked in Fico\u2019s office before resigning in the wake of the murder.\n\nThe two have denied any links to the killing.",

Currently there is no cure or prevention for the irreversible, progressive brain condition, which usually develops in people after age 60.\n\nLead author Dr. Yadong Huang, a senior investigator and director of the Center for Translational Advancement at Gladstone, told UPI he is working with an undisclosed startup pharmaceutical company in the San Francisco Bay area to \"further develop the apoE4 structure corrector approach and move toward clinic trials.\"\n\n\"My lab and my collaborators are working hard to move our discovery toward clinical trials as quickly as we can,\" he told UPI.\n\nHuang said apoE4 can be targeted directly for Alzheimer's disease drug development, but that there is no defined timetable for clinical trials.\n\n\"It is difficult to estimate when a drug could be on the market given the complexity of drug development,\" Huang said. \"We are likely several years away from a drug being on the market, but with concerted effort, we are working to accelerate the timeline as much as possible.\n\nHuang said he has been working with Dr. Robert W. Mahley at the Gladstone Institutes for over 20 years on apoE and Alzheimer's disease, especially on developing apoE4 structure correctors.\n\n\"Drug development for Alzheimer's disease has been largely a disappointment over the past 10 years,\" Huang said in a press release. \"Many drugs work beautifully in a mouse model, but so far they've all failed in clinical trials. One concern within the field has been how poorly these mouse models really mimic human disease.\"\n\nHuang used human cells to model the disease and test new drugs.\n\nBut he told UPI that \"animal models continue to be very important to test possible drug toxicity and to test the efficacy of a new drug in vivo.\"\n\nFor the first time, they examined the effect of apoE4 on the human brain by creating neurons from skin cells donated by Alzheimer's patients with two copies of the apoE4 gene, as well as from healthy individuals who also have two copies of the apoE3 gene.\n\nResearchers said one copy of the apoE4 gene more than doubles a person's likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease, and two copies increases the risk by 12-fold.\n\nIn human neurons, the apoE4 protein not functioning properly is broken down into disease-causing fragments in the cells. The process leads to issues often observed with Alzheimer's disease, including the accumulation of the protein tau and of amyloid peptides.\n\nAlthough apoE4 does not change the production of amyloid beta in mouse neurons, it increases amyloid beta production in humans.\n\n\"There's an important species difference in the effect of apoE4 on amyloid beta,\" said Dr. Chengzhong Wang, a former research scientist at Gladstone. \"Increased amyloid beta production is not seen in mouse neurons and could potentially explain some of the discrepancies between mice and humans regarding drug efficacy. This will be very important information for future drug development.\"\n\nResearchers examined brain cells that did not produce either form of the apoE protein. But if they added apoE4, the cells had pathologies related to Alzheimer's disease. So, apoE4, and not the absence of apoE3, develops the disease.\n\nBy treating human apoE4 neurons with a structure corrector, it eliminated the signs of Alzheimer's disease, restored normal function to the cells and improved cell survival.",

After the shooter opens fire, knocking the man to the ground, one of the voices says in Hebrew, \"Wow. What a video! Yes! That son of a bitch.\"\n\nThe video's release comes at a highly sensitive time for Israel's military, which is under increasing international scrutiny for its use of live fire on the Gaza border. At least 31 Palestinians have been killed and hundreds more wounded following the outbreak of protests and clashes at the border since March 30.\n\nSaeb Erekat, a top official with the Palestinian Authority, has described the shootings as \"extrajudicial killings.\"\n\nThere have been no critical Israeli casualties.\n\nRead more: Israel-Gaza border: Protests turn fatal\n\nThe video shows an Israeli soldier open fire on what appears to be an unassuming Palestinian standing close to the Gaza border fence\n\nIsraeli ministers praise shooter\n\nAfter the authenticity of the video was confirmed, Lieberman told reporters that the sniper \"deserves a medal\" for shooting the Palestinian, but that the solider who recorded the incident should be demoted.\n\nThe military said the unauthorized filming and distribution of the material would be dealt with accordingly.\n\nIsraeli Education Minister Naftali Bennett of the far-right Jewish Home party also justified the shooter's behavior, telling army radio: \"Judging soldiers because they are not expressing themselves elegantly while they are defending our borders is not serious.\"\n\nIsraeli Public Security Minister Gilad Erdan downplayed the significance of the video, telling local media that the video \"doesn't show gunfire at everyone, but at a terrorist who approaches the barrier in an unauthorized zone coming from an area controlled by Hamas terrorists.\"\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process UN Security Council Resolution 242, 1967 United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, passed on November 22, 1967, called for the exchange of land for peace. Since then, many of the attempts to establish peace in the region have referred to 242. The resolution was written in accordance with Chapter VI of the UN Charter, under which resolutions are recommendations, not orders.\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process Camp David Accords, 1978 A coalition of Arab states, led by Egypt and Syria, fought Israel in the Yom Kippur or October War in October 1973. The conflict eventually led to the secret peace talks that yielded two agreements after 12 days. This picture from March 26, 1979, shows Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, his US counterpart Jimmy Carter and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin after signing the accords in Washington.\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process The Madrid Conference, 1991 The US and the former Soviet Union came together to organize a conference in the Spanish capital city of Madrid. The discussions involved Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestinians \u2014 not from the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) \u2014 who met with Israeli negotiators for the first time. While the conference achieved little, it did create the framework for later, more productive talks.\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process Oslo I Accord, 1993 The negotiations in Norway between Israel and the PLO, the first direct meeting between the two parties, resulted in the the Oslo I Accord. The agreement was signed in the US in September 1993. It demanded that Israeli troops withdraw from West Bank and Gaza and a self-governing, interim Palestinian authority be set up for a five-year transitional period. A second accord was signed in 1995.\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process Camp David Summit Meeting, 2000 US President Bill Clinton invited Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to the retreat in July 2000 to discuss borders, security, settlements, refugees and Jerusalem. Despite the negotiations being more detailed than ever before, no agreement was concluded. The failure to reach a consensus at Camp David was followed by renewed Palestinian uprising, the Second Intifada.\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process The Arab Peace Initiative, 2002 The Camp David negotiations were followed first by meetings in Washington and then in Cairo and Taba, Egypt \u2014 all without results. Later the Arab League proposed the Arab Peace Initiative in Beirut in March 2002. The plan called on Israel to withdraw to pre-1967 borders so that a Palestinian state could be set up in the West Bank and Gaza. In return, Arab countries would agree to recognize Israel.\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process The Roadmap, 2003 The US, EU, Russia and the UN worked together as the Middle East Quartet to develop a road map to peace. While Palestinian Prime Minister Mahmoud Abbas accepted the text, his Israeli counterpart Ariel Sharon had more reservations with the wording. The timetable called for a final agreement on a two-state solution to be reached in 2005. Unfortunately, it was never implemented.\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process Annapolis, 2007 In 2007 US President George W. Bush hosted a conference in Annapolis, Maryland, to relaunch the peace process. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas took part in talks with officials from the Quartet and over a dozen Arab states. It was agreed that further negotiations would be held with the goal of reaching a peace deal by the end of 2008.\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process Washington, 2010 In 2010, US Middle East Envoy George Mitchell convinced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to and implement a ten-month moratorium on settlements in disputed territories. Later, Netanyahu and Abbas agreed to relaunch direct negotiations to resolve all issues. Negotiations began in Washington in September 2010, but within weeks there was a deadlock.\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process Cycle of escalation and ceasefire continues A new round of violence broke out in and around Gaza late 2012. A ceasefire was reached between Israel and those in power in the Gaza Strip, which held until June 2014. The kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June 2014 resulted in renewed violence and eventually led to the Israeli military operation Protective Edge. It ended with a ceasefire on August 26, 2014.\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process Paris Summit, 2017 Envoys from over 70 countries gathered in Paris, France, to discuss the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Netanyahu slammed the discussions as \"rigged\" against his country. Neither Israeli nor Palestinian representatives attended the summit. \"A two-state solution is the only possible one,\" French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said at the opening of the event.\n\nA history of the Middle East peace process Deteriorating relations in 2017 Despite the year's optimistic opening, 2017 brought further stagnation in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. A deadly summer attack on Israeli police at the Temple Mount, a site holy to both Jews and Muslims, sparked deadly clashes. Then US President Donald Trump's plan to move the embassy to Jerusalem prompted Palestinian leader Abbas to say \"the measures ... undermine all peace efforts.\" Author: Aasim Saleem\n\n\n\nOn the Palestinian side, however, senior official Hanan Ashrawi said the video showed what Palestinians have long decried as Israeli soldiers' everyday behavior on the Gaza border, \"but nobody has been listening.\"\n\nAn unwelcome reminder\n\nFor both sides of the conflict, the incident presented a stark reminder of a 2016 video filmed by a human rights group that showed an Israeli soldier shooting a prone Palestinian assailant in the head without any apparent provocation.\n\nThe Israeli soldier, Elor Azaria, was convicted of manslaughter but the case highlighted Israel's public divide between those who denounced the killing and those who believed it was justified.\n\nRead more: What it means to be a soldier in Israel\n\nSeveral right-wing Israeli politicians called for Azaria to be pardoned, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

        "article.text": "How close the world is to a catastrophic collapse of giant ocean currents is unknown, making halting global warming more critical than ever, scientists say\n\nSerious disruption to the Gulf Stream ocean currents that are crucial in controlling global climate must be avoided \u201cat all costs\u201d, senior scientists have warned. The alert follows the revelation this week that the system is at its weakest ever recorded.\n\nPast collapses of the giant network have seen some of the most extreme impacts in climate history, with western Europe particularly vulnerable to a descent into freezing winters. A significantly weakened system is also likely to cause more severe storms in Europe, faster sea level rise on the east coast of the US and increasing drought in the Sahel in Africa.\n\nThe new research worries scientists because of the huge impact global warming has already had on the currents and the unpredictability of a future \u201ctipping point\u201d.\n\nThe currents that bring warm Atlantic water northwards towards the pole, where they cool, sink and return southwards, is the most significant control on northern hemisphere climate outside the atmosphere. But the system, formally called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (Amoc), has weakened by 15% since 1950, thanks to melting Greenland ice and ocean warming making sea water less dense and more buoyant.\n\nThis represents a massive slowdown \u2013 equivalent to halting all the world\u2019s rivers three times over, or stopping the greatest river, the Amazon, 15 times. Such weakening has not been seen in at least the last 1,600 years, which is as far back as researchers have analysed so far. Furthermore, the new analyses show the weakening is accelerating.\n\n\u201cFrom the study of past climate, we know changes in the Amoc have been some of the most abrupt and impactful events in the history of climate,\u201d said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and one of the world\u2019s leading oceanographers, who led some of the new research. During the last Ice Age, winter temperatures changed by up to 10C within three years in some places.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with a system that in some aspects is highly non-linear, so fiddling with it is very dangerous, because you may well trigger some surprises,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish I knew where this critical tipping point is, but that is unfortunately just what we don\u2019t know. We should avoid disrupting the Amoc at all costs. It is one more reason why we should stop global warming as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nOceanographer Peter Spooner, at University College London, shares the concern: \u201cThe extent of the changes we have discovered comes as a surprise to many, including myself, and points to significant changes in the future.\u201d\n\nA collapse in the Amoc would mean far less heat reaching western Europe and plunge the region into very severe winters, the kind of scenario depicted in an extreme fashion in the movie The Day After Tomorrow. A widespread collapse of deep-sea ecosystems has also been seen in the past.\n\nBut as the Amoc weakens, it might actually increase summer heatwaves. That is because it takes time for the cooling of the northern waters to also cause cooling over the adjacent lands. However, the cooler waters affect the atmosphere in a way that helps warm air to flood into Europe from the south, a situation already seen in 2015.\n\nGulf Stream current at its weakest in 1,600 years, studies show Read more\n\nOther new research this week showed that Greenland\u2019s massive ice cap is melting at the fastest rate for at least 450 years. This influx will continue to weaken the Amoc into the future until human-caused climate change is halted, but scientists do not not know how fast the weakening will be or when it reaches the point of collapse.\n\n\u201cMany people have tried to check that with computer models,\u201d said Rahmstorf. \u201cBut they differ a lot because it depends on a very subtle balance of density \u2013 that is temperature and salinity distribution in the ocean. We are not able to model this with any confidence right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are hoping to somehow make some headway, but I have been in this area for more than 20 years now and we still don\u2019t understand why the models differ so much in the sensitivity of the Amoc,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, Rahmstorf said the international climate deal agreed in 2015 offers some hope if its ambition is increased and achieved: \u201cIf we can keep the temperature rise to well below 2C as agreed in the Paris agreement, I think we run a small risk of crossing this collapse tipping point.\u201d",

        "article.text": "President Trump won\u2019t be happy. Scotland is fast becoming the go-to destination for offshore wind innovation, and the project he spent so long opposing is leading the way.\n\nThe first of 11 huge wind turbines has this week been installed by Swedish developer Vattenfall off the Aberdeen coast.\n\nThe wind farm is located about 1.5 miles from shore and fully visible from a nearby golf course built by the US President in Balmedie.\n\nAnd two of the machines being constructed have been upgraded to 8.8 megawatts, the first time this has ever been used by the offshore wind industry.\n\nThe innovation means that just one rotation of its blades will be able to power the average UK home for an entire day. The newly installed turbine now reaches 190 metres into the air at its very tip, twice the height of Big Ben in London.\n\nMr Trump spent years in both Scottish and UK courts seeking to scupper the project. After losing his final appeal at the UK Supreme Court in December 2015, the project went ahead with construction.\n\nOnce complete the project will have an installed capacity of 93.2MW, and be able to provide over 70 percent of Aberdeen\u2019s domestic electricity demand, according to Vattenfall. It will also be able to displace over 134,000 tonnes of CO2.\n\nThe wind farm, made possible by funding from the European Union, is officially called the European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC).\n\nVattenfall\u2019s project director, Adam Ezzamel, commented: \u201cThe first turbine installation is a significant achievement and credit to the diligence and engineering know-how of the project team and contractors. For it to be one of the 8.8MW models makes it an even more momentous moment because it further endorses the EOWDC as a world-class hub of offshore wind innovation.\u201d\n\nJean Morrison, Chair of Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG), said the wind farm is \u201cleading the way in terms of innovation for the offshore wind sector and will help enable the next generation of offshore wind\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real coup for the region to have the world\u2019s most powerful turbines on its doorstep and cements Aberdeen\u2019s position as a major global energy city. It also will lead us to a greener future,\u201d she added.\n\nThe news closely follows the successful launch of the first floating offshore wind farm, also in Aberdeenshire, but further from shore.\n\nTime lapse footage of the turbine being installed in Scottish waters",

        "article.text": "Special counsel Robert Mueller's team is examining a series of previously unreported meetings that took place in 2017 in the Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, as part of its broader investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, according to two sources briefed on the investigation.\n\nThe sources said several of those meetings took place around the same time as another meeting in the Seychelles between Erik Prince, founder of the security company Blackwater, Kirill Dmitriev, the director of one of Russia's sovereign wealth funds, and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the effective ruler of the United Arab Emirates (also known as \"MBZ\"). Details of that earlier meeting were first reported by the Washington Post last year.\n\nThe sources requested to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.\n\nThe inquiry into the meetings in the Seychelles suggests there is growing interest on the Mueller team in whether foreign financing, specifically from Gulf states, has influenced President Trump and his administration.\n\nThe New York Times reported in March that Mueller's team questioned George Nader, a Lebanese-American businessman who helped broker the Seychelles meeting, about whether the Emiratis attempted to buy political influence in the White House.\n\nDocuments obtained by this reporter, and interviews with those familiar with the probe, suggest Mueller is also looking at other foreign influencers, including individuals from Russia and from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe meetings in the Seychelles are a key component of Mueller's investigation, sources familiar with the investigation said. The meetings connect powerful players from Russia, the U.S., the UAE and Saudi Arabia across the political, financial and defense worlds. The details of what was discussed in the meetings in January and in the following months, however, are scarce.\n\nFlight records and financial documents obtained by this reporter over twelve months, as well as interviews with parliamentary and aviation officials in the Seychelles, paint a scene out of a Hollywood thriller.\n\nWealthy and politically-connected individuals from across the globe -- from Russia, France, Saudi Arabia and South Africa -- land in the Seychelles for meetings that take place as a part of a larger gathering hosted by MBZ, according to an individual briefed on the matter, who also requested anonymity. Many of them fly in on private jets and several do not clear customs. Some check into the Four Seasons Hotel while others arrive and stay on their yachts.\n\nIndividuals connected to the Saudi financial system, including the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency and the Arab National Bank, flew into the island the second week of January 2017, as did an aircraft purportedly owned by the former deputy minister of defense, Prince Khaled bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz, fight records show. Other individuals on those aircraft held passports from Egypt and Singapore.\n\nDmitriev flew into the Seychelles Jan. 11, 2017 with his wife Natalia Popova and another woman with the last name Boldovskaia. Six other Russian individuals flew to the island just a few days after Dmitriev. The aircraft's ownership is unclear but it flew between Russia, Geneva and Cyprus in 2017.\n\nOthers on the island included Alexander Mashkevitch, an alleged financier of Bayrock, an investment vehicle linked to Trump, and Sheikh Abdulrahman Khalid BinMahfouz, according to flight records. BinMahfouz's father, before his death, was a billionaire and the former chairman of Saudi Arabia's first private bank.\n\nNader travelled to Seychelles Jan. 7, 2017 and again on March 24 on an aircraft with the tail number VP-CZA, flight records show. The aircraft is registered to Gryphon Asset Management, an aviation consulting company based out of Dubai.\n\nNader is a well-known advisor to the UAE with links to Dmitriev and members of the Saudi Royal family. He has attended meetings at the White House with Stephen Bannon and Jared Kushner in the past, according to the Times, and has also been linked to Trump fundraiser and deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee Elliot Broidy.\n\nThe Associated Press reported last month Nader sent Broidy $2.5 million through a Canadian company. Broidy then began giving donations to members of Congress who were actively supporting legislation critical of Qatar, the AP reported.\n\nThe previously reported meeting in the Seychelles between Prince, Dmitriev and MBZ was described as an attempt by the U.S. to set up a backchannel with Russia. The Post reported that Blackwater founder Erik Prince, an informal adviser to the Trump team, acted as a representative of the administration in the meeting with an unnamed Russian individual.\n\nLater, this reporter broke the news in The Intercept that Prince had met with Dmitriev -- the head of the sovereign wealth fund with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Prince admitted in a congressional testimony earlier this year that he had met Dmitriev on the island, but said it was a chance meeting.\n\nMueller's team has received evidence challenging Prince's testimony, according to an ABC News report.\n\nErin Banco may be reached at ebanco@njadvancemedia.com.

        "article.text": "Russia had tested whether door handles could be used to deliver nerve agents and had targeted the email accounts of Sergei and Yulia Skripal since at least 2013, according to previously classified intelligence over the Salisbury attack that has been made public.\n\nThe UK released the intelligence on Friday linking Russia to the attack on the former double agent and his daughter.\n\nThe door handle and email claims were made in a letter from Sir Mark Sedwill, the UK\u2019s national security adviser, to the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg. It is extremely rare for the UK to make such intelligence public.\n\nIn the letter, Sedwill, who has an overview of the work of all British spy services, filled in some of the intelligence that Theresa May referred to when she made a House of Commons statement saying Russia was highly likely to have been behind the attack.\n\nLetter to the Nato secretary general\n\nIn response, the Russian ambassador in London Alexander Yakovenko announced that the embassy would be publishing its own report on the attack.\n\n\u201cThe British Government still hasn\u2019t produced any evidence in support of its position that would confirm their official version,\u201d he told a press conference, at which he showed footage of Tony Blair apologising for intelligence mistakes made in the run-up to the Iraq war. \u201cWe get the impression the British Government is deliberately pursuing the policy of destroying all possible evidence.\u201d\n\nIn his Nato letter, Sedwill said the nerve agent novichok had been developed at the Russian research facility in Shikhany as part of an offensive chemical weapons programme with the codename Foliant.\n\n\n\nSedwill said Russia regarded at least some of its defectors as \u201clegitimate targets for assassination\u201d, with the suggestion that they could include Skripal, a former member of the GRU, Russian military intelligence, who was convicted by Russia of espionage in 2004 after working for MI6.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have information indicating Russian intelligence service interest in the Skripals, dating back at least as far as 2013, when email accounts belonging to Yulia Skripal were targeted by GRU cyber specialists,\u201d Sedwill wrote.\n\n\n\nHe also said: \u201cDuring the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents and to train personnel from special units in the use of these weapons. This programme subsequently included investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents, including by application to door handles. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of novichoks under the same programme.\u201d\n\nHe said Russia had continued developing small amounts of novichok over the past decade.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s chemical weapons programme continued after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By 1993, when Russia signed the chemical weapons convention (CWC), it is likely that some novichoks had passed acceptance testing, allowing their use by the Russian military,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s CWC declaration failed to report any work on novichoks. Russia further developed some novichoks after ratifying the convention. In the mid-2000s, President [Vladimir] Putin was closely involved in the Russian chemical weapons programme. It is highly unlikely that any former Soviet republic (other than Russia) pursued an offensive chemical weapons programme after independence. It is unlikely that novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (eg a criminal or terrorist group).\u201d\n\nThe decision to release the intelligence is partly in response to Russia\u2019s repeated denials that it is responsible for the attack and suggestions of alternative scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is linked to the United Nations, confirmed on Thursday that a novichok nerve agent had been used in the Salisbury attack.\n\nSedwill wrote: \u201cI would like to share with you andallies further information regarding our assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the Salisbury attack. Only Russia has the technical means, operational experience and the motive.\u201d\n\nThe term \u201chighly likely\u201d is one commonly used by the intelligence agencies when they believe something is 100% certain \u2013 since they are unwilling to express that opinion without a caveat in case of error.\n\n\u201cRussia has a proven record of conducting state-sponsored assassination,\u201d Sedwill said, concluding: \u201cThere is no plausible alternative explanation.\u201d\n\nAs well as questioning the UK\u2019s evidence, the Russian ambassador to London complained at the continued refusal of consular access to Yulia Skripal.\n\n\u201cWe are not allowed to see our citizens, talk to doctors, have no idea about the treatment the Russian nationals receive,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot be sure that Yulia\u2019s refusal to see us is genuine. We have every reason to see such actions as the abduction of two Russian nationals.\u201d\n\n",

        "article.text": "HELENA, Mont. (AP) \u2014 An online pharmacy that bills itself as Canada's largest was fined $34 million Friday for importing counterfeit cancer drugs and other unapproved pharmaceuticals into the United States, a sentence that one advocacy group called too light for such a heinous crime.\n\nCanada Drugs has filled millions of prescriptions by offering itself as a safe alternative for patients to save money on expensive drugs, and its founder, Kris Thorkelson, has been hailed as an industry pioneer for starting the company in 2001.\n\nBut U.S. prosecutors say Canada Drugs' business model is based entirely on illegally importing unapproved and misbranded drugs not just from Canada, but from all over the world. The company has made at least $78 million through illegal imports, including two that were counterfeit versions of the cancer drugs Avastin and Altuzan that had no active ingredient, prosecutors said.\n\nAfter more than two years of struggling to get the international company to appear in U.S. court to face the felony charges, Canada Drugs and Thorkelson, struck a plea deal with prosecutors late last year.\n\nOn Friday, a judge in Missoula, Montana, approved federal prosecutors' recommended sentences that include $29 million forfeited, $5 million in fines and five years' probation for Canada Drugs.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dana Christensen also sentenced Thorkelson to six months' house arrest, five years' probation and a $250,000 fine.\n\nCanada Drugs also will permanently cease the sale of all unapproved, misbranded and counterfeit drugs and will surrender all of the domain names for the myriad websites it used to sell the drugs, under the deal.\n\nAn advocacy group had urged the judge to impose harsher penalties to deter future crimes.\n\n\"Counterfeiting oncology medications is a nearly untraceable and heinous health care crime,\" Shabbir Imber Safdar, executive director of the Partnership for Safe Medicines, wrote in a letter to the judge. \"You put saline in a bottle, and when the cancer patient takes it, there is no evidence in the patient of the crime.\"\n\nAfter the sentencing, Safdar called the penalties \"a slap on the wrist and an insult to the victims of Canada Drugs' crimes.\"\n\nSafdar said Thorkelson should receive prison time and that Thorkelson's and Canada Drugs' pharmacy licenses should be surrendered. The group also wants Canada Drugs to give up all of its internet domain names, including ones not named in the plea deal, to prevent the company from continuing to sell misbranded and counterfeit medicine.\n\nCanada Drugs' and Thorkelson's attorneys did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nFederal prosecutors wrote in court documents that the recommended sentence is appropriate. U.S. Attorney for Montana Kurt Alme said after the sentencing that Thorkelson and Canada Drugs jeopardized the health and safety of Americans by circumventing the Food and Drug Administration's approval process.\n\n\"As this case shows, American providers and consumers need to beware when purchasing drugs on the internet,\" Alme said in a statement.\n\nThe case is being handled in the U.S. state of Montana, where Canada Drugs bought another company for its drug inventory and customer list when it was expanding in 2009. Canada Drugs continued to deposit money into that company's Montana bank account from doctors' purchase of the illegally imported drugs before the proceeds were shipped to offshore accounts in the Caribbean, prosecutors said.\n\nThe company and two overseas subsidiaries pleaded guilty to introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce, and the subsidiaries also agreed to plead guilty to selling counterfeit drugs.\n\nThorkelson pleaded guilty to knowing about and concealing a felony crime.",

        "article.text": "OTTAWA\u2014Library and Archives Canada is promising to fulfill an Ottawa researcher\u2019s access to information request. It just needs until 2098. In correspondence reviewed by the Star, the federal department said it needed at minimum eight decades to review 780,000 records related to a mysterious RCMP investigation called Project Anecdote. Researcher Michael Dagg requested the documents through the access to information system, which allows any Canadian to request government information for a $5 fee. By law, most requests must be fulfilled within 30 days. Library and Archives Canada initially told Dagg the department would require a deadline extension of 292,000 days \u2014 or about 800 years. But later emails, which project a delay of closer to a century, suggest that number was a typo.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n\u201cYou will note the extensive list of responsive records and we have determined that the extension for volume would be \u2026 an 80-year minimum (bringing the due date to the year 2098),\u201d Dagg was told. \u201cOur initial (estimate) was a 130-year extension, however, based on the classification of these records \u2026 by the 80th year most, if not all of these records could be opened without recourse to the (Access to Information) Act.\u201d To put that in context, the average life expectancy in Canada is 82 years. If a particularly industrious toddler were to request that information today, they would have about even odds of seeing the documents in their lifetime.\n\n\u201cIt defeats the whole purpose of the act,\u201d Dagg told the Star in an interview Thursday, adding he intends to complain to the federal information commissioner. An independent researcher, Dagg is investigating an old RCMP case he suspects was closed 15 years ago, though few details are publicly known. Dino Roberge, a spokesperson for Library and Archives Canada, told the Star via email that the department \u201cmust consider the volume and format of material that must be processed and whether it must consult with other organizations on the content of the material.\u201d \u201cThis then determines how long it will take to process the request.\u201d The legislated 30-day deadline for departments to fulfill access requests has been missed with increasing frequency in recent years. In 2015-2016, only 64 per cent of federal access to information requests were completed by deadline. Former information commissioner Suzanne Legault often highlighted the problem of delays. She warned that some institutions use extensions to compensate for high workloads or lack of resources. A spokesperson for the information watchdog\u2019s office, Natalie Bartlett, said they could not comment on specific cases. \u201c(But) delays have been the subject of thousands of complaints to the (office) since 1983,\u201d Bartlett wrote in a statement. \u201cEvery information commissioner since the coming into force of the act has raised this as an issue.\u201d Bartlett said the office has recently dealt with extensions as long as 1,110 days at the Department of National Defence, and as long as 9,840 days at another institution.",

A retired revenue department official planned the crimes against her, says the chargesheet filed by the crime branch of the Jammu and Kashmir police.\n\nSanji Ram planned the abduction because he wanted to scare the Bakarwals and make them move out of Rassana village in the Hiranagar tehsil of Kathua, alleges the chargsheet. He allegedly enticed his nephew, a school dropout, into committing the crime, it says.\n\nEight people have been charged in the case: Sanji Ram, his nephew, Sanji Ram\u2019s son Vishal Jangotra, a friend of the nephew, a police sub-inspector, a head constable and two special police officers. The nephew was first identified as a juvenile although the charge sheet said a DNA test showed him to be 19-years-old.\n\nThe nephew allegedly told Sanji Ram\u2019s son, Vishal Jangotra, in Meerut over the phone about the abduction of the girl and asked him to come to Kathua \u201cif he wanted to satisfy his lust\u201d.\n\nThe policemen were supposed to help destroy evidence and cover up the crime in exchange for bribes, it\u2019s alleged.\n\nThe girl was held in a temple identified as Devasthan, which is run by Sanji Ram, after she was kidnapped, drugged constantly and subjected to multiple rapes including gang rape.\n\nThe girl was held in the temple until January 14 before the nephew strangled her to death and bludgeoned her with a stone to make sure she was dead, said the charge sheet.\n\nIt added that before she was killed, one of the accused asked his accomplices to \u201cwait\u201d as he also wanted to rape the girl. Her body was found on January 17 not too far from Devasthan.\n\nAccording to the charge sheet, \u201cwhatever surfaced in the course of investigation leads to the irresistible conclusion\u201d that the eight \u201cundoubtedly committed offences\u201d including kidnapping, wrongful confinement, gang rape, murder and tampering with evidence.\n\nIt also mentions that investigators along with forensic experts and a first-class executive magistrate visited the crime scene and a minute examination of the locations, including Devasthan, led to the recovery of blood stained wooden sticks and hair strands.\n\nA few hair strands recovered from Devasthan and the nearby forest where the body was dumped, were sent to New Delhi for a DNA profiling. One of the strands from Devasthan matched with the girl\u2019s DNA profile.",

        "article.text": "Image copyright AFP Photo/ HO/ Douma City Co-Ordination Committee Image caption Footage from Douma in the aftermath of the attack appeared to show people using water to counteract the effects\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has demanded \"unhindered access\" to Douma in Syria to check reports from its partners that 500 people were affected by a chemical attack there.\n\nThe Syrian government denies being behind any use of chemical weapons.\n\nThe US has threatened a \"forceful\" response to the reported attack but Russia has called it a pretext to attack its ally, Syria.\n\nThe WHO cited reports that 70 people had been killed.\n\nIt said its \"health cluster\" partners reported that 500 people had suffered symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals, including difficulty breathing, irritation of mucous membranes, and disruption to the central nervous system.\n\n\"Two health facilities were also reportedly affected by these attacks,\" the WHO statement continued.\n\n\"We should all be outraged at these horrific reports and images from Douma,\" said Dr Peter Salama of the WHO. \"WHO demands immediate unhindered access to the area to provide care to those affected, to assess the health impacts, and to deliver a comprehensive public health response.\"\n\nWhat happened in Douma?\n\nSyrian opposition activists, rescue workers and medics allege that an attack on Douma in the Eastern Ghouta region near Damascus on Saturday was carried out by government forces using bombs filled with toxic chemicals.\n\nThe Syrian-American Medical Society said more than 500 people had been found with symptoms \"indicative of exposure to a chemical agent\".\n\nIt said this included breathing difficulties, bluish skin, foaming mouths, corneal burns and \"the emission of chlorine-like odour\".\n\nThe estimates of how many people died in the suspected chemical attack range from 42 to more than 60 people.\n\nThe French representative at the UN Security Council said poison gas had deliberately been used as it could seep down into basements.\n\nFollowing the alleged attack, Syria and Russia reached an evacuation deal with the Jaysh al-Islam rebels, who up until now have been holding Douma.\n\nWhat will happen next?\n\nIt seems the US and its allies may be preparing for a military strike.\n\nUS President Donald Trump cancelled his first official trip to Latin America so he could focus on Syria.\n\nThat decision suggests the US response may involve a larger military operation than a limited strike, says the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The US president has said \"nothing's off the table\" - so what options are on the table?\n\nWashington has also been in discussion with France and the UK, raising the prospect of co-ordinated Western military action.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said any strikes would target Syrian government chemical facilities.\n\nBut The Times reports that the UK's Prime Minister Theresa May has urged Mr Trump to provide more evidence of the suspected chemical attack.\n\nA US Navy guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, is in the Mediterranean, and the European air traffic control agency, Eurocontrol, has warned airlines to take \"due consideration\" while in the eastern Mediterranean over the next few days, because of the possible launch of missiles into Syria.\n\nSeveral senior Russian figures have warned of a Russian response to a US attack.\n\nAlexander Zasypkin, Moscow's ambassador to Lebanon, was the latest, repeating a warning by the head of the military that missiles would be shot down and their launch sites targeted.\n\nMoscow's UN ambassador warned Washington that it would \"bear responsibility\" for any \"illegal military adventure\" it carried out.\n\nWhat is the UN doing?\n\nOn Tuesday the UN Security Council failed to pass any measures to set up an inquiry into the alleged attack.\n\nAs permanent members of the council, Russia and the US both have the power to veto. They both blocked each other's proposals to set up independent investigations.\n\nThe US-drafted resolution would have allowed investigators to apportion blame for the suspected attack, while Russia's version would have left that to the Security Council.\n\nA team from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is due to deploy to Syria \"shortly\" to determine whether banned weapons were used in Douma.\n\nBut the OPCW will not seek to establish who was responsible for the attack.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption US ambassador Nikki Haley and Russian ambassador Vasily Nebenzia clashed at the UN\n\nThe UN session was the latest in a series of showdowns between Russia and the US and saw harsh words exchanged between the countries.\n\nRussian ambassador Vasily Nebenzia accused the US of \"planting\" a resolution\" as a justification for military action.\n\n\"We could find ourselves on the threshold of some very sad and serious events,\" he said.\n\nUS envoy Nikki Haley responded by calling the vote a \"travesty\".\n\n\"Russia has trashed the credibility of the council,\" she said. \"Whenever we propose anything meaningful on Syria, Russia vetoes it.\"",
